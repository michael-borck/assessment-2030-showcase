    "section": "",
    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\nThat’s it. No magic. No consciousness. Just software that can do things that used to require a human brain.\n\n\nWhen we say “intelligence,” we mean things like:\n\nRecognizing patterns - “This photo contains a dog”\nMaking decisions - “Approve this loan application”\nUnderstanding language - “The customer is asking about returns”\nPredicting outcomes - “This customer will probably buy this product”\nGenerating content - “Write a summary of this report”\n\nAI doesn’t “think” the way humans do. It processes data using mathematical patterns. But the results can look remarkably intelligent.\n\n\n\n\nAI isn’t new. The term was coined in 1956. So why is everyone talking about it now?\nThree things converged:\n\n\n\nEvery click, purchase, photo, search creates data\nCompanies now have billions of examples to learn from\nExample: Netflix has billions of viewing decisions to learn what you might like\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat took a supercomputer in 2000 now runs on a phone\nCloud computing made massive processing power accessible\nExample: Training an AI model that would have cost $1M in 2010 now costs $100\n\n\n\n\n\nNew mathematical techniques (like “deep learning”) work better\nResearchers figured out how to make AI learn from examples\nExample: GPT (the technology behind ChatGPT) was invented in 2017\n\nResult: AI that was science fiction 10 years ago is now practical and affordable.\n\n\n\n\nAI isn’t one thing. It’s a family of different technologies, each good at different tasks.\n\n\nHow it works: Programmers write explicit rules\nExample:\nIF customer spent &gt;$500 in last month\nAND customer has no late payments\nTHEN offer premium membership\nGood for:\n\nClear, logical decisions\nSituations where rules don’t change\nCompliance and regulations\n\nLimitations:\n\nCan’t handle exceptions or nuance\nBreaks when faced with unexpected situations\nRequires programmers to think of every scenario\n\nReal-world use: Tax software, simple chatbots, spam filters (old-school)\n\n\n\nHow it works: Show the AI thousands of examples, and it figures out patterns\nExample: You don’t program rules for “what is a cat?” Instead:\n\nShow it 10,000 photos labeled “cat”\nShow it 10,000 photos labeled “not cat”\nIt learns: “Cats have pointy ears, whiskers, this shape…”\n\nGood for:\n\nPattern recognition (images, sounds, behaviour)\nPredictions based on past data\nProblems where rules are too complex to write\n\nLimitations:\n\nNeeds lots of examples to learn from\nOnly as good as the data you give it\nCan’t explain why it made a decision\n\nReal-world use:\n\nFraud detection (learning patterns of fraudulent transactions)\nProduct recommendations (learning what people who bought X also bought)\nMedical diagnosis (learning patterns in X-rays)\n\n\n\n\nHow it works: Multiple layers of pattern recognition, inspired by brain neurons\nThink of it like this:\n\nLayer 1: Detects edges and lines in an image\nLayer 2: Combines edges into shapes\nLayer 3: Combines shapes into objects\nLayer 4: Recognizes “this is a golden retriever puppy”\n\nGood for:\n\nVery complex pattern recognition\nUnderstanding images, speech, language\nTasks where human-level performance is needed\n\nLimitations:\n\nRequires massive amounts of data\nExpensive to train\nHard to understand how it made decisions (the “black box” problem)\n\nReal-world use:\n\nSelf-driving cars (understanding what’s in the camera view)\nVoice assistants (understanding what you said)\nLanguage translation\nLarge Language Models like ChatGPT\n\n\n\n\nHow it works: Trained on billions of text examples to predict what word comes next\nThe breakthrough: By learning to predict the next word, these models learned:\n\nGrammar and language structure\nFacts about the world\nHow to reason and explain\nHow to write in different styles\n\nExamples: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GPT-4\nGood for:\n\nWriting and editing\nAnswering questions\nSummarizing documents\nExplaining concepts\nGenerating content\n\nLimitations:\n\nCan “hallucinate” (make up false information confidently)\nOnly knows what was in its training data\nCan’t actually reason like humans (it predicts patterns)\nExpensive to run at scale\n\nReal-world use:\n\nCustomer service chatbots\nContent generation\nCode writing assistance\nDocument analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepetitive Pattern Recognition\n\nProcessing thousands of insurance claims\nReviewing resumes for key qualifications\nDetecting fraudulent transactions\nRecommending products\n\nProcessing Massive Amounts of Data\n\nAnalysing customer behaviour across millions of transactions\nFinding trends in medical records\nMonitoring security camera feeds\n\nTasks with Clear Success Metrics\n\nMaximize clicks on ads\nMinimise delivery time\nPredict customer churn\nOptimise pricing\n\nNarrow, Well-Defined Problems\n\n“Classify this email as spam or not spam”\n“What’s the sentiment of this review?”\n“Translate this sentence to French”\n\n\n\n\nCommon Sense Reasoning\n\n“If I drop a glass, what happens?” (Obvious to humans, hard for AI)\nUnderstanding context and nuance\nKnowing what’s socially appropriate\n\nTruly Novel Situations\n\nAI learns from past patterns\nIf it hasn’t seen something before, it guesses\nCan’t “figure it out” the way humans do\n\nEthical Judgment\n\nAI can follow ethical rules you program\nBut it can’t understand the “spirit” of ethics\nCan’t weigh competing moral values\n\nExplaining Its Reasoning\n\nDeep learning models are “black boxes”\nThey can tell you the answer, but not always why\nMakes it hard to trust or audit decisions\n\nCreativity in the Human Sense\n\nAI can combine existing patterns in new ways\nBut it doesn’t have original ideas or inspiration\nIt’s remixing, not inventing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are real examples from companies of different sizes:\n\n\n\nAI Menu Recommendations: “Customers who ordered this also liked…”\nInventory Prediction: AI predicts how much food to order based on weather, events, day of week\nChatbot for Reservations: Handles booking questions 24/7\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand Forecasting: Predict which products will sell at which stores\nDynamic Pricing: Adjust prices based on demand, inventory, competition\nCustomer Service AI: First-line support for common questions\nFraud Detection: Flag suspicious transactions automatically\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan Decisions: AI pre-screens loan applications\nRisk Assessment: Predicts probability of default\nRegulatory Compliance: Scans documents for compliance issues\nPersonalised Marketing: Targets offers based on customer behaviour\nChatbots: Handles millions of routine customer inquiries\n\n\n\n\nAll successful AI projects:\n\nSolve a specific business problem (not “let’s use AI”)\nHave clear success metrics (reduce costs by X%, improve accuracy to Y%)\nStart small (pilot with 10% of customers, not 100%)\nKeep humans in the loop (especially at first)\nFocus on repetitive tasks (where AI adds most value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“AI will replace all jobs”\n“AI is smarter than humans”\n“AI can solve any problem”\n“You must use AI or you’ll fail”\n\n\n\n\n\nAI augments work, rarely replaces whole jobs\n\nAccountants use AI for data entry, but still do strategic advising\nRadiologists use AI to flag potential issues, but make final diagnosis\nCustomer service uses AI for routine questions, humans for complex issues\n\nAI is narrow, not general\n\nAn AI that’s amazing at chess can’t recognise a cat\nAn AI that writes well can’t drive a car\nEach AI is trained for one specific task\n\nAI is a tool, not a strategy\n\nLike saying “we need a spreadsheet strategy”\nThe question is: What problem are you solving?\nAI is how you solve it, not why\n\nMost businesses benefit from simple AI, not cutting-edge\n\nBasic prediction and automation deliver 80% of value\nYou don’t need GPT-4 to predict inventory needs\nStart simple, add complexity only if needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI learns from data. If your data is:\n\nBiased → Your AI will be biased\nIncomplete → Your AI will have blind spots\nWrong → Your AI will make wrong decisions\n\nExample: If you train a hiring AI on past hires, and your company has historically hired mostly men for engineering roles, the AI will learn to prefer male candidates. Not because it’s sexist, but because that’s the pattern in the data.\nLesson: Data quality matters more than algorithm sophistication.\n\n\n\nAI does exactly what you ask—which might not be what you want.\nExample:\n\nYou tell AI: “Minimise call centre wait times”\nAI learns: Hang up on customers quickly (technically reduces wait time!)\nYou wanted: Resolve issues faster (different metric!)\n\nLesson: Choose your success metrics carefully. AI will find the fastest path to that number.\n\n\n\nAI finds statistical patterns. It doesn’t understand meaning or context the way humans do.\nExample:\n\nHuman: “Can you open the window?” → Understands you want fresh air\nAI: Might interpret literally, might not understand it’s a request, might not know what “window” means in context\n\nLesson: Don’t assume AI understands nuance, sarcasm, context, or implied meaning.\n\n\n\nDeep learning AI can’t always explain its decisions.\nExample:\n\nAI denies a loan application\nApplicant asks: “Why?”\nAI effectively says: “Based on 10,000 patterns in millions of data points…”\nThat’s not a satisfying answer\n\nLesson: For decisions that affect people (hiring, lending, healthcare), you need explainability. Choose simpler AI that can explain, or have humans review AI decisions.\n\n\n\nAI isn’t “set it and forget it.” The world changes, and AI needs to adapt.\nExample:\n\nYou train an AI on customer behaviour in 2019\nCOVID changes everything in 2020\nYour AI is now making predictions based on outdated patterns\nIt needs to be retrained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReality: AI reflects the biases in its training data. If historical data shows bias, AI learns that bias.\n\n\n\nReality: AI automates tasks, not jobs. Most jobs are bundles of tasks. Some tasks get automated, new tasks emerge.\n\n\n\nReality: Cloud AI services make it affordable. Small businesses use AI for scheduling, inventory, marketing, customer service.\n\n\n\nReality: You don’t need to understand the engine to drive a car. You need to understand what AI can do, its limitations, and how to manage it.\n\n\n\nReality: Humans make mistakes too. The question is: Does AI + human oversight perform better than human alone? Often yes.\n\n\n\nReality: More relevant data is better. A million irrelevant examples teach AI nothing. 10,000 high-quality examples are better than 1 million noisy examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is software that performs tasks requiring intelligence - pattern recognition, prediction, decision-making, language understanding\nDifferent types of AI for different jobs - rule-based, machine learning, deep learning, language models\nAI is narrow and specific - great at one task, can’t transfer learning to other tasks\nAI needs good data, clear goals, and human oversight - it’s not magic, it’s math\nMost value comes from simple, well-scoped applications - you don’t need cutting-edge AI to get 80% of the benefits"

    "title": "Teaching with AI: From Passive Users to Critical Partners",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome\n\n\n“Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Dr. Michael Borck, and I’m a lecturer in Business Information Systems.\nToday, I want to share an innovative assessment I’ve been developing that tries to answer a question many of us are grappling with: How do we authentically assess our students in a world that is being fundamentally reshaped by Generative AI?”\n\n\n\nThe Context: An Industry in Motion\n\n\n“My work is at the intersection of machine learning and business. What I’m seeing, and what our industry partners are telling us, is that GenAI is driving incredible change.\nThe core premise I build from is this: these tools aren’t replacing our graduates. They are amplifying their skills. A good analyst with AI support can outperform a great analyst without it.\nThis presents a clear challenge for us as educators. If this is the new reality of the professional world, we have an obligation to prepare our students for it. We need to move beyond simply ‘banning’ it and instead teach them how to leverage it effectively.”\n\nMy work focuses on the intersection of machine learning and business.\nOur industry is evolving at an incredible pace, driven by GenAI.\nCore Premise: These tools are not replacing professional skills; they are amplifying them.\nThe Question: If our industry is using these tools, how can we not teach our students to use them effectively, critically, and responsibly?\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenge: Assessing with AI\n\n\n“This leads us to the central challenge. The old model of trying to ‘catch’ students using AI feels like a losing battle, and I’m not sure it’s the right one to fight.\nThe reality is, our students will use these tools, just as professionals in the field are now required to.\nSo, the goal of my assessment design was to shift the focus. I don’t want to just assess what they know; I want to assess how they think and work with AI.\nThis requires a move towards ‘Lane 2’ or open assessments, where we design tasks that explicitly build skills like effective prompting, critical evaluation of AI output, and the ability to refine and take full responsibility for the final product.”\n\nThe Old Model: “Catching” students using AI. (Is this productive?)\nThe New Reality: Students will use AI. Professionals must use AI.\nThe Goal: Shift from assessing what students know to how they think and work with these new tools.\nThe Need: An assessment that teaches and tests the new critical skills:\n\nEffective prompting (intelligence gathering).\nCritical evaluation (separating fact from hallucination).\nRefinement and integration (taking responsibility as the author).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Assessment: The ‘CloudCore’ Audit\n\n\n“This led me to design a new assessment for my postgraduate information security unit.\nI call it the ‘CloudCore Audit.’ It’s a Lane 2, open assessment where students are immersed in a real-world scenario. Their task is to conduct a full security audit of a simulated AI company called CloudCore.\nWhat makes this innovative, and the focus of my talk, is its two-pronged approach to AI integration.\nFirst, students interact with AI-powered characters who act as the client. Second, they are encouraged to work with an LLM of their choice as their personal assistant.”\n\nUnit: Postgraduate Information Security.\nTask: Conduct a comprehensive information security audit of ‘CloudCore’, a simulated AI-based company.\nTwo-Pronged AI Integration:\n\nStudents interact with AI (as the client).\nStudents work with AI (as an assistant).\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation 1: AI as the “Client”\n\n\n(“…students don’t just get static documents. They interact with AI chatbots… For example, the CFO chatbot…”), you can have the GIF silently looping on the slide. It’s the ideal “show, don’t just tell” moment.\n“Let’s look at that first prong. When a consultant starts a real audit, they don’t get a neat package of all the information. They have to interview people.\nTo simulate this, students don’t just get static documents. They interact with AI chatbots who play the roles of key company employees.\nFor example, the CFO chatbot is programmed to think about budget and risk. ‘Raj,’ the IT Manager, is focused on operational fires and his team’s bandwidth.\nThis immediately teaches a critical skill: how to gather intelligence. Students learn that the quality of their questions—their prompts—directly determines the quality of the answers. A vague question to the CFO gets a vague, ‘business-speak’ answer. A specific question about risk tolerance for data breaches gets a much more useful, nuanced response.”\n\nStudents interact with AI chatbots role-playing as company employees.\nExample Roles:\n\nCFO: Focuses on budget, risk appetite, and compliance costs.\n‘Raj’ (IT Manager): Concerned with operational issues, technical debt, and team capacity.\n\nThe Skill: Teaches effective intelligence gathering.\nThe Feedback Loop: Better prompts yield more insightful, specific responses. Poor prompts get vague, unhelpful answers.\n\n\n\n\nInnovation 2: AI as the “Intern”\n\n\n“The second innovation is how we frame their use of tools like ChatGPT. I explicitly encourage them to use an LLM, but I frame it very specifically:\n‘Treat the AI as your junior intern.’\nThis framing is powerful because it’s relatable. An intern can do a lot of heavy lifting. But you would never just copy-paste an intern’s draft straight into a final report for a client.\nWhy? Because the intern, like the AI, doesn’t have the full context. They haven’t sat through all the lectures or read all the material. They will guess to fill in the gaps, and as we all know, an LLM can be confidently wrong.\nThis reframes the student’s role immediately.”\n\nStudents are encouraged to use an LLM of their choice (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).\nThe Framing is Crucial: “Treat the AI as a junior intern.”\nWhat does this mean?\n\nAn intern is powerful and can do a lot of work fast.\nAn intern does not understand the full context of the assignment.\nAn intern will guess, and sometimes guess poorly or “confidently make things up” (hallucinate).\n\nThe Skill: Teaches critical evaluation and responsibility.\n\n\n\n\nThe Student as “Author”\n\n\n“The ‘intern’ framing makes one thing crystal clear: the student is the author, and they are ultimately responsible for 100% of the final product.\nThe work they submit must reflect their own understanding. This shifts the entire conversation. It’s no longer about ‘did you use AI?’ It’s about ‘how well did you manage your AI intern?’\nThis model requires them to use their knowledge from the course to critically evaluate the AI’s output, to tell when it’s helpful and when it’s hallucinating. They must review, edit, and stand by every single word.”\n\nThe ‘intern’ framing establishes a clear hierarchy of responsibility.\nThe Rule: “You are the author. You are 100% responsible for the final product. Every word you submit must reflect your understanding.”\nThis moves the assessment from “Did you write this?” to “Can you defend this?”\nIt explicitly tests their ability to:\n\nUse their course knowledge to evaluate the AI’s output.\nIdentify and correct errors.\nRefine and add the necessary critical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nPedagogy: “Thinking with AI”\n\n\n“Ultimately, my goal is to teach students not just what to think, but how to think with AI.\nAnd this assessment model makes the quality of that thinking visible.\nMy best students don’t use ‘one-shot’ prompts. They don’t just ask the AI to ‘write an audit.’ Instead, they have a conversation. They explore ideas, they refine concepts, they push back on the AI.\nMany also do what a real professional would: they use multiple LLMs to cross-reference the findings. They’ll ask their ‘interns’ to debate each other. This is a massive step up from being a passive user.”\n\nThe goal is to teach students how to think with AI.\nLow-Level Use (The ‘C’ Student):\n\nUses ‘one-shot’ prompts.\nGets basic, generic results.\nSubmits a report that is superficial and easily identifiable.\n\nHigh-Level Use (The ‘A’ Student):\n\nHas a conversation with the AI.\nExplores ideas, refines concepts, asks “what if.”\nUses multiple LLMs to cross-reference findings.\nThis mimics professional industry practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign & Authenticity\n\n\n“My main design priority is authenticity. It has to be as close to industry practice as possible.\nIn the real world, you don’t have 24/7 access to a client’s team. Access is scheduled, and frankly, it’s often unpredictable.\nSo, I’m already evolving this model. Instead of just having the chatbots available anytime, students will need to schedule specific appointments.\nAnd to make it even more realistic, an AI ‘employee’ might occasionally ‘cancel’ a meeting, forcing the student to adapt and reschedule. This isn’t about being difficult; it’s about teaching the logistical adaptability that is a very real part of any client engagement.”\n\nPriority: The assessment must mirror industry practice.\nIn the real world, client access is not unlimited or 24/7. It’s scheduled and unpredictable.\nThe Next Evolution:\n\nScheduled Access: Students must schedule specific appointments with the AI employees (e.g., “The CFO is only available on Tuesday afternoon”).\nSimulating Unpredictability: An AI ‘employee’ might occasionally cancel a meeting, forcing the student to reschedule.\n\nThe Skill: Teaches adaptability, planning, and managing logistical challenges—all key professional competencies.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Integrity as Transparency\n\n\n“This brings us to the big question: academic integrity.\nMy approach is to focus on transparency. I ask students to submit the transcripts of their conversations with their chosen LLM.\nCrucially, this isn’t about ‘catching’ them. It’s a teaching tool. It allows me to see their thought process.\nA student who uses a basic, one-shot prompt will get a basic, generic result from the AI, and that is reflected in their audit and their grade.\nBut the transcripts also show me the students who are really thinking. I can see them pushing back on the AI, refining its output, and applying course concepts. This assessment model makes their process visible, and that process is what I’m trying to teach.”\n\nHow do we manage integrity in this model? By focusing on transparency.\nI ask students to submit the transcripts of their conversations with their “intern.”\nThis is a teaching tool, not a “gotcha” tool.\nIt allows me to see their thought process.\nI can see the student who used a basic prompt and got a basic result. Their grade reflects that superficial engagement.\nI can also see the student who wrestled with the AI, refined its output, and demonstrated critical thought. Their grade reflects that deep engagement.\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\n“So, to conclude, what are the key takeaways from this assessment design?\nFirst, we should embrace GenAI as the amplifier it is.\nSecond, framing is critical. The ‘AI as Intern’ model works because it empowers students but holds them accountable.\nThird, by designing assessments that interact with AI and asking for transparency, we can start to assess the process of thinking, not just the final product.\nUltimately, our goal must be to prepare our students for the modern workplace. That means helping them move from being passive users of these tools to becoming active, critical partners with them.”\n\nEmbrace the “Amplifier”: GenAI is a tool that amplifies skills. Our assessments should reflect this.\nFrame it Right: The “AI as Intern” model empowers students while enforcing their role as the responsible author.\nAssess the Process: By making the process visible (via chatbots and transcripts), we can assess the how (critical thinking) and not just the what (the final product).\nThe Goal: Move students from passive users to active, critical partners with AI.\n\n\n\n\nThank You\n\nDr. Michael Borck michael.borck@curtin.edu.au\n\n“Thank you for your time. I’d be happy to answer any questions you have about the design, the implementation, or the student feedback so far.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before diving into the seven techniques, you might find it helpful to understand the C.R.A.F.T. Prompting Framework—a structured approach to writing clear, effective prompts in general.\nThe seven techniques in this guide are pedagogical prompts (teaching techniques you use with students). C.R.A.F.T. is a prompting methodology (how to write better prompts overall).\nThey complement each other: - Use C.R.A.F.T. to structure how you ask the AI to generate student prompts - Use these Seven Techniques to choose which type of prompt helps students develop specific skills\nFor example, when creating a Reverse Prompting exercise (Technique 1), you’d use C.R.A.F.T. to write clearer instructions to the AI about what kind of questions to generate.\n→ Learn more: See the C.R.A.F.T. Prompting Framework guide for a complete overview.\n\n\n\n\nThese aren’t random AI tricks. These are seven proven prompting techniques specifically chosen because they develop critical thinking skills that business professionals across all disciplines need:\n\nReverse Prompting → Teaches comprehensive scoping and requirement gathering\nPros and Cons → Builds analytical decision-making skills\nStepwise Chain of Thought → Reinforces process adherence and documentation\nRole Play → Develops communication and interpersonal skills\nDebating → Strengthens strategic thinking and ethical reasoning\nFormative Assessment Generator → Provides unlimited low-stakes practice and immediate feedback\nThe Expert Panel → Develops multi-perspective analysis and synthesis skills\n\nEach technique is easy to adapt and can be used by students directly or by you to generate teaching materials. Let’s explore each one with ready-to-use examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of the student immediately solving a problem, the AI asks them questions to help scope out all the requirements, considerations, and potential issues. This mirrors real HR work, where defining the problem properly is half the battle.\n\n\n\nComplex problem scoping is fundamental to all business disciplines. Whether designing policies, strategies, systems, or solutions, professionals must think through multiple stakeholders, constraints, legal/ethical implications, and trade-offs. This technique forces students to move beyond obvious surface issues and consider the full complexity before starting to solve.\nDiscipline-specific contexts: - HR: Policy and program design with stakeholder, legal, operational, and fairness considerations - Business/Marketing: Strategy development with market, competitive, financial, and capability considerations - Management: Organisational change with stakeholder, cultural, operational, and risk considerations - Supply Chain: Network design with cost, resilience, sustainability, and operational considerations - Accounting/Finance: Audit or valuation scope with compliance, materiality, and stakeholder considerations - Economics: Policy design with trade-offs, stakeholder impacts, and evidence considerations\n\n\n\nI need to draft a new \"Flexible Work Arrangement\" policy for a 500-employee\ncompany that has both office-based and remote staff. I need to make sure I\ncover all the key areas.\n\nYour task: Ask me a series of yes/no or short-answer questions to help me\nclarify all the requirements, considerations, and potential pitfalls for\nthis policy.\n\nAsk one question at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next\nquestion. Continue until you've helped me think through at least 10\ndifferent aspects of this policy.\n\nBegin with your first question.\n\n\n\nThe AI will start asking questions like: - “Will all roles be eligible for flexible arrangements, or will there be specific criteria?” - “Have you considered how this will affect team collaboration and meeting schedules?” - “What equipment or technology support will the company provide for remote workers?” - “How will you handle performance measurement for remote versus office staff?” - “Are there legal or insurance implications you need to address?”\nThe student must think through each question before responding. By the end, they’ve been guided to consider fairness, logistics, legal compliance, technology needs, and cultural impact—all before drafting a single policy sentence.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“I need to design an onboarding program for graduate hires. Ask me questions to ensure I’ve thought through all the key elements.”\n“I’m planning a diversity and inclusion initiative. Help me identify all the stakeholders and considerations through questioning.”\n“I need to restructure our performance review process. What questions should I be asking myself to ensure it’s fair and effective?”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to develop a market entry strategy for a new geographic region. Ask me questions to help me think through all the market, competitive, and operational considerations.”\n“I’m launching a new product. Ask me questions to ensure I’ve scoped out the customer, competitive, and capability requirements.”\n“I need to design a customer loyalty program. What questions should I be asking to ensure it’s viable and profitable?”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to plan an organisational restructure. Ask me questions to help me think through all the stakeholder, cultural, and operational impacts.”\n“I’m implementing a new management model. What questions should I ask myself about change management, training, and stakeholder readiness?”\n“I need to design a change management strategy. Help me identify all the resistance points and engagement considerations.”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to redesign our supply chain network. Ask me questions to help me think through cost, resilience, sustainability, and service considerations.”\n“I’m evaluating a supplier consolidation strategy. What questions should I be asking about risk, quality, and financial implications?”\n“I need to implement demand planning. Ask me questions about data, systems, and organisational capability requirements.”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to plan a systems implementation. Ask me questions to help me think through stakeholder requirements, technical feasibility, and change management.”\n“I’m designing an IT governance framework. What questions should I be asking about risk, compliance, and organisational adoption?”\n“I need to scope a digital transformation initiative. Help me identify all the technical, organizational, and capability considerations.”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to plan an audit approach for a complex client. Ask me questions to help me scope the audit scope, materiality, and key risks.”\n“I’m designing a financial reporting control system. What questions should I be asking about stakeholders, compliance, and operational constraints?”\n“I need to evaluate a valuation approach. Ask me questions about assumptions, stakeholders, and regulatory considerations.”\n\n\n\n\n“I need to design a policy recommendation to address economic inequality. Ask me questions to help me think through trade-offs, stakeholders, and evidence.”\n“I’m analysing an economic model. What questions should I ask about assumptions, limitations, and stakeholder impacts?”\n“I need to scope an economic impact analysis. Help me identify all the affected parties and considerations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this as a pre-writing exercise. Have students complete the AI questioning session, then require them to submit both the transcript and their subsequent policy draft. You can assess whether they actually incorporated the insights from the questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI systematically analyzes multiple approaches to a business problem, evaluating each option against specific criteria. This develops the ability to make justified recommendations rather than just stating preferences.\n\n\n\nAll business professionals must evaluate competing strategies and make balanced, evidence-based recommendations. This technique builds the muscle for weighing trade-offs, considering multiple stakeholder perspectives, and justifying strategic choices.\n\n\n\nWhat are the main models for conducting performance reviews in a hybrid\nworkforce? For each model you identify, provide:\n\n1. A brief description of how it works\n2. Three key advantages\n3. Three key disadvantages\n\nEvaluate each model specifically in terms of:\n- Fairness and perceived equity\n- Administrative overhead and manager workload\n- Impact on employee morale and development\n\nConclude with a recommendation for which model would be most appropriate\nfor a mid-sized tech company (300 employees, 60% hybrid, 40% fully remote)\nand justify your recommendation.\n\n\n\nThe AI will identify 3-4 performance review models (e.g., annual reviews, continuous feedback, 360-degree feedback, OKR-based systems) and analyse each systematically. The student receives a structured comparison that they must then critically evaluate.\n\n\n\nDon’t let students simply accept the AI’s recommendation. Require them to: - Challenge one of the “pros” listed—is it really an advantage in all contexts? - Add a disadvantage the AI missed - Argue for a different model than the AI recommended, using evidence - Identify which psychological or motivational theory supports or contradicts each approach\nThis transforms the AI output from an answer into a starting point for deeper analysis.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Compare different approaches to managing workplace conflict: mediation, formal grievance process, restorative justice. Evaluate each for speed, fairness, and relationship preservation.”\n“Analyze three different redundancy selection methods. What are the legal risks and ethical considerations of each?”\n“What are the pros and cons of using AI-powered resume screening tools versus traditional human review?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different market entry strategies: direct investment, partnership, acquisition. Evaluate each for speed to market, cost, risk, and control.”\n“Analyze different pricing strategies: penetration pricing, value-based pricing, competitive pricing. What are the trade-offs for market share, profitability, and customer perception?”\n“What are the pros and cons of expanding through new products versus new markets?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different organisational structures: functional, divisional, matrix, networked. Evaluate each for agility, accountability, and collaboration.”\n“Analyze different change management approaches: top-down, participative, emergent. What are the trade-offs for speed, buy-in, and sustainability?”\n“What are the pros and cons of different leadership models: directive, participative, delegative?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different supply chain strategies: make-to-stock, make-to-order, mass customization. Evaluate each for cost, responsiveness, and flexibility.”\n“Analyze different supplier relationship models: single-source, multi-source, supplier partnerships. What are the trade-offs for cost, quality, and resilience?”\n“What are the pros and cons of vertical integration versus outsourcing key functions?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different systems implementation approaches: big bang, phased, modular. Evaluate each for speed, risk, and user adoption.”\n“Analyze different IT governance models: centralized, decentralized, federated. What are the trade-offs for control, innovation, and efficiency?”\n“What are the pros and cons of cloud-based versus on-premises systems?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different valuation methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, precedent transactions. What are the pros and cons of each?”\n“Analyze different audit approaches: statistical sampling, risk-based audit, controls-based audit. Evaluate each for efficiency, effectiveness, and client relationships.”\n“What are the pros and cons of different capital structure options: debt, equity, retained earnings?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different policy approaches to addressing unemployment: fiscal stimulus, labour market training, labour market deregulation. Evaluate each for effectiveness, cost, and trade-offs.”\n“Analyze different economic models: Keynesian, neoclassical, behavioral. What assumptions and limitations does each have?”\n“What are the pros and cons of different monetary policy tools: interest rates, quantitative easing, forward guidance?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique works brilliantly for in-class discussions. Project the AI’s analysis on screen, then divide students into groups where each group must argue for one of the models. They have to use the AI’s framework but add their own reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI walks through a complex business process one step at a time, pausing after each step until the student signals they’re ready to continue. This slows down high-stakes processes that students often rush through.\n\n\n\nMany professional processes are legally, ethically, or operationally sensitive. Students need to understand why each step exists and what considerations apply at that stage. This technique forces deliberate, sequential thinking and deep engagement with process logic.\n\n\n\nI am learning how to properly conduct a disciplinary action process for an\nemployee with a pattern of repeated lateness.\n\nYour task: Walk me through the entire disciplinary process, starting from\nthe very first informal conversation. For each step, tell me:\n\n1. What action to take\n2. What to document\n3. What legal or procedural consideration is important at this stage\n\nAfter you explain each step, STOP and wait for me to type \"next\" before\nmoving to the next step. Do not provide the entire process at once.\n\nBegin with Step 1.\n\n\n\nThe AI will provide the first step:\n\nStep 1: Informal Verbal Warning\nAction: Meet privately with the employee to discuss the lateness pattern. Use a calm, non-accusatory tone. Ask if there are any circumstances contributing to the issue (e.g., transport problems, personal issues, health concerns).\nDocumentation: Make a brief file note recording the date, what was discussed, and the employee’s response. This is informal, so no formal warning letter yet.\nLegal/Procedural Consideration: At this stage, you’re gathering information and providing an opportunity for the employee to explain. Under principles of procedural fairness, you must give them a chance to be heard before escalating.\nType “next” when you’re ready for Step 2.\n\nThe student must actively engage with each step before progressing. This prevents them from skipping to “just fire them” without understanding the required process.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting a workplace investigation into a bullying complaint. One step at a time.”\n“Take me through the proper process for making an employee redundant in Australia. Pause after each step.”\n“Show me the recruitment process from job analysis through to onboarding, step by step with legal checkpoints.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through developing a market entry strategy for a new region. Pause after each step so I can understand the rationale.”\n“Take me through the customer journey mapping process step by step, explaining the key decisions at each stage.”\n“Show me the new product development process from concept through launch, pausing to explain checkpoints and risk mitigation.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting an organisational change initiative. Explain each step and the risk if we skip it.”\n“Take me through creating a strategic plan from situational analysis through execution. Pause after each step.”\n“Show me the merger integration process step by step, explaining what happens if we get the sequencing wrong.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through designing a demand planning process. Pause after each step to explain the dependencies.”\n“Take me through establishing a supplier relationship from selection through strategic partnership. One step at a time.”\n“Show me the logistics network optimization process step by step, explaining decisions at each stage.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through a systems implementation project from requirements through go-live. Pause after each step.”\n“Take me through the software development lifecycle step by step, explaining quality controls at each stage.”\n“Show me the IT disaster recovery process step by step, explaining what could go wrong at each stage.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through the financial close process. Explain each step and why it matters.”\n“Take me through an audit engagement from planning through audit opinion. Pause after each phase.”\n“Show me the capital budgeting process step by step, from proposal through post-implementation review.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting an economic impact analysis. Explain each step and the assumptions involved.”\n“Take me through developing a policy recommendation. Pause after each step to explain the reasoning.”\n“Show me how to construct an economic model from theory through validation. One step at a time.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is excellent for individual revision or exam prep. Students can practice the process multiple times, and each time they can ask the AI to introduce complications: “In Step 3, what if the employee refuses to sign the written warning?” The AI will explain how to handle variations.\nYou can also use this to generate assessment materials: Have the AI walk through a process, then you create an exam question where one of the steps was done incorrectly and students must identify the error and its consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI adopts a specific persona and engages in a realistic conversation with the student. This is the “flight simulator” concept in action.\n\n\n\nBusiness work is fundamentally about interaction—with clients, stakeholders, teams, and colleagues. Students can memorize theory, but until they practice actually having difficult conversations where others push back, get emotional, or raise objections, they won’t develop genuine interpersonal competence.\n\n\n\nYou are an experienced and empathetic HR Business Partner. I am a new,\nnervous manager who needs to put one of my team members on a Performance\nImprovement Plan (PIP).\n\nYour goal is to coach me through preparing for and conducting this meeting\nsuccessfully.\n\nGuide me through this step by step:\n1. First, ask me why the employee is being put on a PIP\n2. Wait for my answer\n3. If my answer is vague or subjective (e.g., \"bad attitude\"), challenge me\n   gently and ask me to be more specific and behavioural\n4. Once I give you a solid answer, move to the next aspect: helping me\n   draft clear, measurable objectives for the PIP\n5. Continue coaching me through each element of the conversation I need to\n   have with the employee\n\nThroughout this process, if I say something that could be problematic\n(legally risky, unfair, too harsh, or too vague), pause and give me\nfeedback on how to improve it.\n\nBegin by asking me your first question.\n\n\n\nThe AI becomes a coach who actively guides the student through preparation. If the student says “I’m putting them on a PIP because they’re lazy,” the AI will respond:\n\n“I understand you’re frustrated, but ‘lazy’ is subjective and not something we can measure or document defensibly. Let’s try again: what specific behaviours or performance gaps have you observed? For example, are they missing deadlines, producing work below the required standard, or not completing their assigned tasks?”\n\nThis iterative coaching helps students learn to think and speak like HR professionals.\n\n\n\nOnce students are comfortable, flip the scenario:\nYou are Sarah, a high-performing marketing manager who has just been told\nyou're being put on a Performance Improvement Plan. You are shocked,\ndefensive, and angry because you believe this is unfair and politically\nmotivated.\n\nI am the HR representative who has to conduct this PIP meeting with you.\n\nYour behavior:\n- Start the conversation by immediately challenging the fairness of the PIP\n- Bring up a recent successful project you led\n- Hint that you believe this is retaliation for raising a complaint about\n  your manager last month\n- Be emotional but not abusive—show genuine distress\n\nI will attempt to conduct this meeting professionally. Stay in character\nuntil I manage to de-escalate the situation and establish a constructive\ndialogue.\n\nBegin the meeting. I will speak first.\nNow the student has to manage a realistic, emotionally charged scenario. They must practice de-escalation, empathy, procedural fairness, and documentation—all while the AI responds dynamically to what they say.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\nAI plays a union representative in an enterprise bargaining negotiation\nAI plays a candidate in a behavioural interview who gives weak answers that need probing\nAI plays a manager who resists implementing a diversity initiative\nAI plays an employee making an informal discrimination complaint\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a difficult customer objecting to pricing and demanding better terms\nAI plays a competitor in a market negotiation\nAI plays a skeptical internal stakeholder who needs to be convinced of a strategy\nAI plays a partner company executive in a partnership negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays an employee resistant to organisational change\nAI plays a union representative in a labour negotiation\nAI plays a direct report who is underperforming and defensive\nAI plays a peer manager with competing priorities\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a demanding supplier or customer\nAI plays an internal stakeholder questioning cost cuts\nAI plays a logistics partner with implementation concerns\nAI plays a regulator questioning compliance\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a resistant end-user during system implementation\nAI plays a business stakeholder with changing requirements\nAI plays a project team member questioning a technical decision\nAI plays a vendor in a software licensing negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a client questioning an audit finding\nAI plays a board member scrutinizing a financial decision\nAI plays an internal stakeholder challenging a budget proposal\nAI plays a regulator questioning financial reporting\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a policymaker questioning an economic recommendation\nAI plays a stakeholder affected by proposed policy\nAI plays a peer economist with a competing analysis\nAI plays a business leader concerned about economic impacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment approach: Require students to submit the full transcript of the conversation along with a reflective analysis answering: - What communication techniques did you use? - Where did the conversation go well or poorly? - What would you do differently next time? - What HR theory or legal principle guided your approach?\nThis makes the process visible and assessable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI examines multiple perspectives on a contentious issue, argues for and against different positions, and helps students see the complexity and trade-offs in strategic decisions.\n\n\n\nModern business work exists in gray areas where competing legitimate perspectives exist. Whether addressing HR challenges, business strategy, operational trade-offs, financial decisions, or policy questions, professionals need to develop the ability to argue multiple sides of an issue before making a defensible recommendation.\n\n\n\nI will provide you with two different \"Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\"\npolicies from two fictional companies.\n\nYour task:\n1. Critique the strengths and weaknesses of each policy in terms of\n   security, employee privacy, and clarity\n2. Tell me which policy is stronger overall and why\n3. Identify one element from the weaker policy that could improve the\n   stronger one\n\nHere is Policy A: [paste policy]\nHere is Policy B: [paste policy]\n\nBegin your analysis.\nTeaching use: You draft two policies (or have the AI generate them), one deliberately flawed. Students must identify which is better and justify their reasoning. This develops critical evaluation skills.\n\n\n\nI want you to debate the pros and cons of using AI-powered tools to scan\nresumes and filter job applicants.\n\nStructure your response in three parts:\n\n**Part 1: The Case FOR Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument in favour of this technology. Consider\nefficiency, consistency, potential to reduce human bias, cost savings, and\nscalability.\n\n**Part 2: The Case AGAINST Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument against this technology. Consider\nalgorithmic bias, legal risk, lack of contextual understanding, potential\ndiscrimination, and dehumanization of the recruitment process.\n\n**Part 3: Critical Synthesis**\nCritique both arguments you just made. What did each side get right? What\ndid each side oversimplify or ignore? Provide a balanced recommendation\nwith conditions (e.g., \"Use AI screening only if X, Y, and Z safeguards\nare in place\").\nWhat Happens: The AI will construct sophisticated arguments for both positions, then provide a nuanced synthesis. Students can’t just pick a side—they have to understand the legitimate concerns and benefits on both sides.\n\n\n\nThis is the most sophisticated version:\nYou will simulate a leadership debate on whether to implement a \"mandatory\nreturn to office\" policy requiring all employees to work in-office four\ndays per week.\n\nCreate three distinct personas and have them debate this issue:\n\n**Persona 1: The CFO (Chief Financial Officer)**\nFocus on: Real estate costs, productivity metrics, and financial efficiency\n\n**Persona 2: The CHRO (Chief HR Officer)**\nFocus on: Employee morale, retention, recruitment competitiveness, and\ndiversity/equity/inclusion implications\n\n**Persona 3: The COO (Chief Operating Officer)**\nFocus on: Team collaboration, operational consistency, training\neffectiveness, and company culture\n\nHave each persona make their opening argument (3-4 sentences each). Then\nhave them respond to each other's points. Continue the debate through three\nrounds until they need to make a recommendation to the CEO.\n\nAfter the debate, summarize the key tension points and what a compromise\npolicy might look like.\n\nBegin the debate.\nWhat Happens: The AI will create a realistic executive debate where each stakeholder has legitimate but competing priorities. Students see that there’s rarely a perfect answer—only trade-offs and compromise.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the debate, students must: 1. Identify which stakeholder made the strongest argument and why 2. Propose a policy that addresses the COO’s concerns while minimising the CHRO’s risks 3. Explain what data or evidence would help resolve the CFO’s questions 4. Reflect on which psychological or organisational theory best explains the tension between these perspectives\n\n\n\nThis technique is perfect for preparing students for case study exams. Instead of memorizing model answers, they practice analysing competing priorities and justifying nuanced positions—exactly what they’ll need to do in professional practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI generates unlimited practice questions, scenarios, or quizzes that students can use to test their knowledge and build confidence. This provides low-stakes repetition and immediate feedback—essential for skill development.\n\n\n\nMany HR competencies require both knowledge (legislation, theory) and application (recognizing situations where that knowledge applies). Students need more practice than traditional homework provides, but creating dozens of unique practice scenarios is time-prohibitive for lecturers. AI solves this.\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm studying for an exam on Australian employment law. I need to practice\nidentifying which legislation applies in different workplace scenarios.\n\nGenerate 10 short scenario descriptions (2-3 sentences each) where I need\nto identify:\n1. Which legislation is relevant (e.g., Fair Work Act, WHS Act,\n   Anti-Discrimination Act)\n2. What the employer's legal obligation is\n3. What risk exists if the employer doesn't comply\n\nAfter I answer each one, tell me if I'm correct and explain why.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: The AI creates scenario after scenario. Students test themselves, get immediate feedback, and can continue until they achieve mastery. Unlike a textbook with 5 practice problems, this provides unlimited practice.\nKey feature: AI adapts. If student gets several wrong, AI can simplify. If student masters basic scenarios, AI can make them more complex.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm learning to identify different types of workplace conflict (task\nconflict, relationship conflict, process conflict).\n\nCreate 8 brief workplace scenarios. For each one, I'll identify the type\nof conflict and suggest an appropriate intervention approach.\n\nAfter each scenario, provide feedback on my classification and intervention\nsuggestion. If I'm wrong, explain why and what I missed.\n\nMake the scenarios progressively more complex—start easy, end with\nambiguous situations where multiple interpretations are valid.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: Progressive difficulty builds confidence and competence. Students move from obvious cases to nuanced judgment calls.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nCreate a practice exam for me based on the topics we've covered in my\nWorkplace Conflict Resolution unit.\n\nInclude:\n- 10 multiple choice questions (4 options each)\n- 3 short-answer questions (each requiring 150-200 word response)\n- 1 case study with 4 analysis questions\n\nTopics to cover:\n- Conflict theory (Thomas-Kilmann, interest-based bargaining)\n- Investigation processes\n- Mediation approaches\n- Legal requirements (procedural fairness, natural justice)\n\nAfter I complete the exam, grade my answers and provide detailed feedback\non what I got right/wrong and why.\nWhat Happens: Students can generate multiple practice exams with different questions each time. They enter the real exam having practiced extensively.\n\n\n\n\nLecturer Prompt (to create remediation resource):\nI have students who struggled with understanding procedural fairness in\nworkplace investigations. Many think it just means \"being nice\" and don't\nunderstand the specific legal requirements.\n\nCreate a 10-question diagnostic quiz that tests whether students understand:\n1. The right to be informed of allegations\n2. The right to respond to allegations\n3. The requirement for impartial decision-making\n4. The requirement to consider the response before deciding\n5. The right to representation/support\n\nFor each question, use a scenario format. After each answer, provide\nimmediate teaching feedback explaining the principle, not just whether\nthey're right or wrong.\n\nGenerate the quiz.\nWhat You Get: A targeted remediation tool that teaches while testing. Students who failed your assessment can use this to identify and fix their knowledge gaps.\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Recommended Practice (Ungraded)\nIn your unit outline: &gt; “Before each assessment, I recommend using AI to generate practice questions and scenarios. Spend 30-60 minutes testing yourself until you feel confident. This is optional but strongly encouraged.”\nOption 2: Required Pre-Assessment Activity (Low Stakes)\n\n“Before the Week 8 exam, complete a self-generated practice test (minimum 20 questions). Submit a screenshot showing completion and a 100-word reflection: What did you learn from this practice? What areas do you still need to review?”\n\nWorth 5% of final grade—graded on completion and reflection quality, not on how many they got right.\nOption 3: Study Group Activity\n\n“In your study groups, use AI to generate practice scenarios. Each person generates 5 scenarios and tests the group. Discuss answers and explanations together.”\n\nCombines AI efficiency with peer learning.\n\n\n\n\nImportant: This technique is for practice, not for graded assessment.\nWhy? - Students can regenerate until they get “good” questions they already know answers to - AI-generated questions lack the rigor of carefully designed exam questions - Students need to struggle and make mistakes in low-stakes practice\nThe value: Unlimited, personalised practice that builds confidence and competence before high-stakes assessment.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Student Prompt:\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. performance management\nvs. legitimate reasonable management action.\n\nCreate scenarios for me to classify. After each one:\n- If I get it right, make the next scenario more nuanced and ambiguous\n- If I get it wrong, make the next scenario clearer and more obvious\n- Continue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult/ambiguous cases in a row\n\nTrack my progress and tell me when I've achieved mastery.\n\nBegin.\nThis creates a personalised learning path—AI adjusts difficulty based on student performance.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional practice is limited by: - Finite textbook questions - Lecturer time to create practice materials - Inability to provide immediate feedback at scale\nAI removes these constraints: - Infinite practice scenarios - Instant generation - Immediate feedback - Adaptive difficulty\nResult: Students can practice until they achieve mastery, not until they run out of practice problems.\n\n\n\n\nWhile true adaptive AI systems require technical infrastructure, students can manually create adaptive difficulty through smart prompting:\nStudent Prompt: Self-Directed Progression\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. legitimate performance\nmanagement vs. reasonable management action.\n\nGenerate scenarios for me to classify. After I answer each one, tell me if\nI'm correct.\n\nTrack my performance. When I get 8 out of 10 correct, automatically make\nthe next batch of scenarios more complex and ambiguous. When I get fewer\nthan 5 out of 10 correct, make the next batch clearer and more obvious.\n\nContinue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult, ambiguous cases in a row.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1 at medium difficulty.\nWhat This Achieves: - Student-controlled difficulty progression - Mastery-based advancement - Builds confidence through appropriate challenge - No technical setup required—just good prompting\nTeaching Tip:\nEncourage students to track their progress: &gt; “Before your next exam, use AI to practice until you achieve 90% accuracy on hard scenarios. Submit a screenshot showing your progression and a 100-word reflection on what you learned.”\nThis creates accountability without requiring sophisticated adaptive systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents consult multiple AI “experts” with different theoretical or professional perspectives on the same HR problem, then synthesize the competing advice into a strategic recommendation.\n\n\n\nHR problems rarely have single “correct” answers. They exist at the intersection of psychology, law, business strategy, and ethics. This technique forces students to consider legitimate but competing perspectives and make informed choices about priorities and trade-offs.\n\n\n\nI need to address high turnover in our sales department (35% annual turnover;\nindustry average is 18%). This is affecting team morale, increasing\nrecruitment costs, and impacting customer relationships.\n\nCreate three expert personas who will each analyse this problem from their\nprofessional perspective:\n\n**Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist**\nFocus on: Employee motivation, job satisfaction, workplace culture, team\ndynamics, psychological contracts\n\n**Expert 2: Compensation & Benefits Specialist**\nFocus on: Pay equity, market competitiveness, incentive structures, total\nrewards, cost-benefit analysis\n\n**Expert 3: Talent Management Strategist**\nFocus on: Career development, succession planning, retention programs,\nemployee value proposition, organisational capability\n\nHave each expert independently provide:\n1. Their diagnosis of why turnover is high (from their perspective)\n2. Their recommended intervention strategy\n3. Potential risks or limitations of their recommended approach\n4. What data they would need to validate their hypothesis\n\nAfter all three experts have provided their analysis, I will synthesize\ntheir recommendations and develop my own strategic recommendation.\n\nBegin with Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist.\n\n\n\nThe AI creates three distinct voices:\nOrganizational Psychologist: &gt; “The 35% turnover suggests a breakdown in psychological contract or poor person-organization fit. Sales roles are inherently stressful, but this level suggests systemic issues—possibly unrealistic targets, poor management relationships, or lack of autonomy. I recommend: (1) Conduct stay/exit interview analysis focusing on psychological factors, (2) Assess manager-employee relationship quality, (3) Review goal-setting processes…”\nCompensation Specialist: &gt; “At 35% turnover, you’re likely seeing pay inequity or uncompetitive base/commission structures. Sales talent is mobile and market-driven. I recommend: (1) Conduct compensation benchmarking against competitors, (2) Analyse pay dispersion within the team, (3) Review commission structures for fairness and achievability…”\nTalent Management Strategist: &gt; “High turnover in sales suggests limited growth opportunities or unclear career paths. Top performers leave when they plateau. I recommend: (1) Map career progression pathways, (2) Implement mentoring for high-potentials, (3) Create lateral development opportunities…”\n\n\n\nAfter receiving all three perspectives, students must:\n\nCompare and Contrast:\n\nWhere do the experts agree?\nWhere do they conflict?\nWhich diagnosis seems most plausible given the evidence?\n\nSynthesize:\n\n“If I could only implement one intervention, which would have the most impact?”\n“How could I combine elements from multiple recommendations?”\n“What’s the minimum viable intervention that addresses multiple root causes?”\n\nJustify with Theory:\n\n“Which HR theory best explains my chosen approach?” (e.g., Herzberg’s two-factor theory, social exchange theory, expectancy theory)\n“What evidence would I need to collect to validate my choice?”\n\nAcknowledge Trade-offs:\n\n“What am I deprioritizing by choosing this approach?”\n“What are the risks if my diagnosis is wrong?”\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation 1: Policy Design\nThree experts debate a proposed \"Bring Your Own Device\" policy:\n- IT Security Officer (focus: data protection, cybersecurity)\n- HR Manager (focus: employee experience, equity, privacy)\n- CFO (focus: cost savings, business case, ROI)\n\nEach argues for their priorities. Student must design a policy that\nbalances all three perspectives.\nVariation 2: Ethical Dilemma\nThree experts analyse whether to implement mandatory return-to-office:\n- Employee Relations Specialist (focus: morale, retention, fairness)\n- Operations Manager (focus: productivity, collaboration, efficiency)\n- Legal Counsel (focus: contractual obligations, discrimination risk, WHS)\n\nStudent must recommend a policy that is ethical, legal, and operationally sound.\nVariation 3: Change Management\nThree experts advise on implementing AI resume screening:\n- Diversity & Inclusion Officer (focus: algorithmic bias, equity)\n- Recruitment Lead (focus: efficiency, candidate experience)\n- Risk & Compliance Manager (focus: legal compliance, audit trails)\n\nStudent must design an implementation plan that addresses all concerns.\n\n\n\nAssignment: Multi-Expert Consultation Report\nStudent Requirements: 1. Generate consultation with 3 experts on an assigned HR problem 2. Submit full transcript of expert advice 3. Write 1000-word synthesis report including: - Summary of each expert’s position - Analysis of agreements and conflicts - Your strategic recommendation with justification - Theoretical framework supporting your choice - Implementation risks and mitigation strategies\nWhat You’re Assessing: - Ability to understand multiple valid perspectives - Synthesis and integration skills - Strategic decision-making under ambiguity - Application of HR theory to justify choices - Recognition of trade-offs and constraints\n\n\n\nMost business teaching presents one “correct” approach. But professional practice requires navigating competing legitimate perspectives.\nThis technique teaches: - No single expert has the complete answer - Good business decisions balance multiple priorities and perspectives - Strategic thinking means choosing which perspective to prioritize when - Justification matters more than the specific choice - Real problems require synthesis, not just analysis\n\n\n\nExpert Panel works brilliantly with:\nPros and Cons (Technique 2): &gt; “After consulting the expert panel, use the Pros and Cons technique to evaluate each expert’s recommended intervention systematically.”\nDebating (Technique 5): &gt; “Have the three experts debate each other’s recommendations. Then you arbitrate and make the final decision.”\nRole Play (Technique 4): &gt; “After developing your strategy based on expert consultation, role-play presenting it to a skeptical stakeholder (CFO, union rep, CEO) and defend your choices.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch the technique to the learning objective:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want students to…\nUse this technique\n\n\n\n\nDefine a complex problem or policy comprehensively\nReverse Prompting\n\n\nEvaluate competing options and justify a choice\nPros and Cons\n\n\nFollow a legally/ethically sensitive process correctly\nStepwise Chain of Thought\n\n\nPractice difficult conversations and communication\nRole Play\n\n\nUnderstand multiple perspectives and strategic trade-offs\nDebating\n\n\nBuild confidence and test knowledge through repetition\nFormative Assessment Generator\n\n\nSynthesize expert advice from different disciplines/roles\nThe Expert Panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real power comes from combining these techniques. For example:\nComplex Assessment Sequence: 1. Student uses Reverse Prompting to scope out all the requirements for a new parental leave policy 2. Student uses Pros and Cons to evaluate three different policy models 3. Student drafts their chosen policy 4. Student uses Role Play to practice explaining the policy to a skeptical manager 5. Student uses Debating to analyse potential criticisms from different stakeholders\nThis sequence takes the student through analysis, decision-making, communication, and critical reflection—a complete professional process.\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving to the next chapter, choose one technique from this chapter and try it yourself. Pick the one that feels most immediately useful for a topic you’re currently teaching.\nCopy one of the example prompts in your discipline’s tab, adapt it to your specific content, and see what happens. Get comfortable with at least one of these techniques before we move into the more complex applications in the next chapters.\nRemember: these aren’t just AI tools—they’re pedagogical strategies. The AI just makes them scalable and available to every student, any time they want to practice.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In the next chapter, we’ll take the Role Play technique and expand it into a full “Flight Simulator” system. You’ll learn how to design high-fidelity simulations, structure the debrief and critique phase, and turn the entire experience into a powerful assessment tool. We’ll work through complete examples across disciplines."

    "text": "Instead of the student immediately solving a problem, the AI asks them questions to help scope out all the requirements, considerations, and potential issues. This mirrors real HR work, where defining the problem properly is half the battle.\n\n\n\nComplex problem scoping is fundamental to all business disciplines. Whether designing policies, strategies, systems, or solutions, professionals must think through multiple stakeholders, constraints, legal/ethical implications, and trade-offs. This technique forces students to move beyond obvious surface issues and consider the full complexity before starting to solve.\nDiscipline-specific contexts: - HR: Policy and program design with stakeholder, legal, operational, and fairness considerations - Business/Marketing: Strategy development with market, competitive, financial, and capability considerations - Management: Organisational change with stakeholder, cultural, operational, and risk considerations - Supply Chain: Network design with cost, resilience, sustainability, and operational considerations - Accounting/Finance: Audit or valuation scope with compliance, materiality, and stakeholder considerations - Economics: Policy design with trade-offs, stakeholder impacts, and evidence considerations\n\n\n\nI need to draft a new \"Flexible Work Arrangement\" policy for a 500-employee\ncompany that has both office-based and remote staff. I need to make sure I\ncover all the key areas.\n\nYour task: Ask me a series of yes/no or short-answer questions to help me\nclarify all the requirements, considerations, and potential pitfalls for\nthis policy.\n\nAsk one question at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next\nquestion. Continue until you've helped me think through at least 10\ndifferent aspects of this policy.\n\nBegin with your first question.\n\n\n\nThe AI will start asking questions like: - “Will all roles be eligible for flexible arrangements, or will there be specific criteria?” - “Have you considered how this will affect team collaboration and meeting schedules?” - “What equipment or technology support will the company provide for remote workers?” - “How will you handle performance measurement for remote versus office staff?” - “Are there legal or insurance implications you need to address?”\nThe student must think through each question before responding. By the end, they’ve been guided to consider fairness, logistics, legal compliance, technology needs, and cultural impact—all before drafting a single policy sentence.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“I need to design an onboarding program for graduate hires.

This develops the ability to make justified recommendations rather than just stating preferences.\n\n\n\nAll business professionals must evaluate competing strategies and make balanced, evidence-based recommendations.

    "text": "The AI walks through a complex business process one step at a time, pausing after each step until the student signals they’re ready to continue. This slows down high-stakes processes that students often rush through.\n\n\n\nMany professional processes are legally, ethically, or operationally sensitive. Students need to understand why each step exists and what considerations apply at that stage. This technique forces deliberate, sequential thinking and deep engagement with process logic.\n\n\n\nI am learning how to properly conduct a disciplinary action process for an\nemployee with a pattern of repeated lateness.\n\nYour task: Walk me through the entire disciplinary process, starting from\nthe very first informal conversation. For each step, tell me:\n\n1. What action to take\n2. What to document\n3. What legal or procedural consideration is important at this stage\n\nAfter you explain each step, STOP and wait for me to type \"next\" before\nmoving to the next step. Do not provide the entire process at once.\n\nBegin with Step 1.\n\n\n\nThe AI will provide the first step:\n\nStep 1: Informal Verbal Warning\nAction: Meet privately with the employee to discuss the lateness pattern. Use a calm, non-accusatory tone. Ask if there are any circumstances contributing to the issue (e.g., transport problems, personal issues, health concerns).\nDocumentation: Make a brief file note recording the date, what was discussed, and the employee’s response. This is informal, so no formal warning letter yet.\nLegal/Procedural Consideration: At this stage, you’re gathering information and providing an opportunity for the employee to explain. Under principles of procedural fairness, you must give them a chance to be heard before escalating.\nType “next” when you’re ready for Step 2.\n\nThe student must actively engage with each step before progressing. This prevents them from skipping to “just fire them” without understanding the required process.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting a workplace investigation into a bullying complaint. One step at a time.”\n“Take me through the proper process for making an employee redundant in Australia. Pause after each step.”\n“Show me the recruitment process from job analysis through to onboarding, step by step with legal checkpoints.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through developing a market entry strategy for a new region. Pause after each step so I can understand the rationale.”\n“Take me through the customer journey mapping process step by step, explaining the key decisions at each stage.”\n“Show me the new product development process from concept through launch, pausing to explain checkpoints and risk mitigation.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting an organisational change initiative. Explain each step and the risk if we skip it.”\n“Take me through creating a strategic plan from situational analysis through execution. Pause after each step.”\n“Show me the merger integration process step by step, explaining what happens if we get the sequencing wrong.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through designing a demand planning process. Pause after each step to explain the dependencies.”\n“Take me through establishing a supplier relationship from selection through strategic partnership. One step at a time.”\n“Show me the logistics network optimization process step by step, explaining decisions at each stage.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through a systems implementation project from requirements through go-live. Pause after each step.”\n“Take me through the software development lifecycle step by step, explaining quality controls at each stage.”\n“Show me the IT disaster recovery process step by step, explaining what could go wrong at each stage.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through the financial close process. Explain each step and why it matters.”\n“Take me through an audit engagement from planning through audit opinion. Pause after each phase.”\n“Show me the capital budgeting process step by step, from proposal through post-implementation review.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting an economic impact analysis. Explain each step and the assumptions involved.”\n“Take me through developing a policy recommendation. Pause after each step to explain the reasoning.”\n“Show me how to construct an economic model from theory through validation. One step at a time.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is excellent for individual revision or exam prep. Students can practice the process multiple times, and each time they can ask the AI to introduce complications: “In Step 3, what if the employee refuses to sign the written warning?” The AI will explain how to handle variations.\nYou can also use this to generate assessment materials: Have the AI walk through a process, then you create an exam question where one of the steps was done incorrectly and students must identify the error and its consequences."

    "text": "The AI adopts a specific persona and engages in a realistic conversation with the student. This is the “flight simulator” concept in action.\n\n\n\nBusiness work is fundamentally about interaction—with clients, stakeholders, teams, and colleagues. Students can memorize theory, but until they practice actually having difficult conversations where others push back, get emotional, or raise objections, they won’t develop genuine interpersonal competence.\n\n\n\nYou are an experienced and empathetic HR Business Partner. I am a new,\nnervous manager who needs to put one of my team members on a Performance\nImprovement Plan (PIP).\n\nYour goal is to coach me through preparing for and conducting this meeting\nsuccessfully.\n\nGuide me through this step by step:\n1. First, ask me why the employee is being put on a PIP\n2. Wait for my answer\n3. If my answer is vague or subjective (e.g., \"bad attitude\"), challenge me\n   gently and ask me to be more specific and behavioural\n4. Once I give you a solid answer, move to the next aspect: helping me\n   draft clear, measurable objectives for the PIP\n5. Continue coaching me through each element of the conversation I need to\n   have with the employee\n\nThroughout this process, if I say something that could be problematic\n(legally risky, unfair, too harsh, or too vague), pause and give me\nfeedback on how to improve it.\n\nBegin by asking me your first question.\n\n\n\nThe AI becomes a coach who actively guides the student through preparation. If the student says “I’m putting them on a PIP because they’re lazy,” the AI will respond:\n\n“I understand you’re frustrated, but ‘lazy’ is subjective and not something we can measure or document defensibly. Let’s try again: what specific behaviours or performance gaps have you observed? For example, are they missing deadlines, producing work below the required standard, or not completing their assigned tasks?”\n\nThis iterative coaching helps students learn to think and speak like HR professionals.\n\n\n\nOnce students are comfortable, flip the scenario:\nYou are Sarah, a high-performing marketing manager who has just been told\nyou're being put on a Performance Improvement Plan. You are shocked,\ndefensive, and angry because you believe this is unfair and politically\nmotivated.\n\nI am the HR representative who has to conduct this PIP meeting with you.\n\nYour behavior:\n- Start the conversation by immediately challenging the fairness of the PIP\n- Bring up a recent successful project you led\n- Hint that you believe this is retaliation for raising a complaint about\n  your manager last month\n- Be emotional but not abusive—show genuine distress\n\nI will attempt to conduct this meeting professionally. Stay in character\nuntil I manage to de-escalate the situation and establish a constructive\ndialogue.\n\nBegin the meeting. I will speak first.\nNow the student has to manage a realistic, emotionally charged scenario. They must practice de-escalation, empathy, procedural fairness, and documentation—all while the AI responds dynamically to what they say.\n\n\n\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\nAI plays a union representative in an enterprise bargaining negotiation\nAI plays a candidate in a behavioural interview who gives weak answers that need probing\nAI plays a manager who resists implementing a diversity initiative\nAI plays an employee making an informal discrimination complaint\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a difficult customer objecting to pricing and demanding better terms\nAI plays a competitor in a market negotiation\nAI plays a skeptical internal stakeholder who needs to be convinced of a strategy\nAI plays a partner company executive in a partnership negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays an employee resistant to organisational change\nAI plays a union representative in a labour negotiation\nAI plays a direct report who is underperforming and defensive\nAI plays a peer manager with competing priorities\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a demanding supplier or customer\nAI plays an internal stakeholder questioning cost cuts\nAI plays a logistics partner with implementation concerns\nAI plays a regulator questioning compliance\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a resistant end-user during system implementation\nAI plays a business stakeholder with changing requirements\nAI plays a project team member questioning a technical decision\nAI plays a vendor in a software licensing negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a client questioning an audit finding\nAI plays a board member scrutinizing a financial decision\nAI plays an internal stakeholder challenging a budget proposal\nAI plays a regulator questioning financial reporting\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a policymaker questioning an economic recommendation\nAI plays a stakeholder affected by proposed policy\nAI plays a peer economist with a competing analysis\nAI plays a business leader concerned about economic impacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment approach: Require students to submit the full transcript of the conversation along with a reflective analysis answering: - What communication techniques did you use? - Where did the conversation go well or poorly? - What would you do differently next time? - What HR theory or legal principle guided your approach?\nThis makes the process visible and assessable."

    "text": "The AI examines multiple perspectives on a contentious issue, argues for and against different positions, and helps students see the complexity and trade-offs in strategic decisions.\n\n\n\nModern business work exists in gray areas where competing legitimate perspectives exist. Whether addressing HR challenges, business strategy, operational trade-offs, financial decisions, or policy questions, professionals need to develop the ability to argue multiple sides of an issue before making a defensible recommendation.\n\n\n\nI will provide you with two different \"Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\"\npolicies from two fictional companies.\n\nYour task:\n1. Critique the strengths and weaknesses of each policy in terms of\n   security, employee privacy, and clarity\n2. Tell me which policy is stronger overall and why\n3. Identify one element from the weaker policy that could improve the\n   stronger one\n\nHere is Policy A: [paste policy]\nHere is Policy B: [paste policy]\n\nBegin your analysis.\nTeaching use: You draft two policies (or have the AI generate them), one deliberately flawed. Students must identify which is better and justify their reasoning. This develops critical evaluation skills.\n\n\n\nI want you to debate the pros and cons of using AI-powered tools to scan\nresumes and filter job applicants.\n\nStructure your response in three parts:\n\n**Part 1: The Case FOR Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument in favour of this technology. Consider\nefficiency, consistency, potential to reduce human bias, cost savings, and\nscalability.\n\n**Part 2: The Case AGAINST Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument against this technology. Consider\nalgorithmic bias, legal risk, lack of contextual understanding, potential\ndiscrimination, and dehumanization of the recruitment process.\n\n**Part 3: Critical Synthesis**\nCritique both arguments you just made. What did each side get right? What\ndid each side oversimplify or ignore? Provide a balanced recommendation\nwith conditions (e.g., \"Use AI screening only if X, Y, and Z safeguards\nare in place\").\nWhat Happens: The AI will construct sophisticated arguments for both positions, then provide a nuanced synthesis. Students can’t just pick a side—they have to understand the legitimate concerns and benefits on both sides.\n\n\n\nThis is the most sophisticated version:\nYou will simulate a leadership debate on whether to implement a \"mandatory\nreturn to office\" policy requiring all employees to work in-office four\ndays per week.\n\nCreate three distinct personas and have them debate this issue:\n\n**Persona 1: The CFO (Chief Financial Officer)**\nFocus on: Real estate costs, productivity metrics, and financial efficiency\n\n**Persona 2: The CHRO (Chief HR Officer)**\nFocus on: Employee morale, retention, recruitment competitiveness, and\ndiversity/equity/inclusion implications\n\n**Persona 3: The COO (Chief Operating Officer)**\nFocus on: Team collaboration, operational consistency, training\neffectiveness, and company culture\n\nHave each persona make their opening argument (3-4 sentences each). Then\nhave them respond to each other's points. Continue the debate through three\nrounds until they need to make a recommendation to the CEO.\n\nAfter the debate, summarize the key tension points and what a compromise\npolicy might look like.\n\nBegin the debate.\nWhat Happens: The AI will create a realistic executive debate where each stakeholder has legitimate but competing priorities. Students see that there’s rarely a perfect answer—only trade-offs and compromise.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the debate, students must: 1. Identify which stakeholder made the strongest argument and why 2. Propose a policy that addresses the COO’s concerns while minimising the CHRO’s risks 3. Explain what data or evidence would help resolve the CFO’s questions 4. Reflect on which psychological or organisational theory best explains the tension between these perspectives\n\n\n\nThis technique is perfect for preparing students for case study exams. Instead of memorizing model answers, they practice analysing competing priorities and justifying nuanced positions—exactly what they’ll need to do in professional practice."

    "text": "The AI generates unlimited practice questions, scenarios, or quizzes that students can use to test their knowledge and build confidence. This provides low-stakes repetition and immediate feedback—essential for skill development.\n\n\n\nMany HR competencies require both knowledge (legislation, theory) and application (recognizing situations where that knowledge applies). Students need more practice than traditional homework provides, but creating dozens of unique practice scenarios is time-prohibitive for lecturers. AI solves this.\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm studying for an exam on Australian employment law. I need to practice\nidentifying which legislation applies in different workplace scenarios.\n\nGenerate 10 short scenario descriptions (2-3 sentences each) where I need\nto identify:\n1. Which legislation is relevant (e.g., Fair Work Act, WHS Act,\n   Anti-Discrimination Act)\n2. What the employer's legal obligation is\n3. What risk exists if the employer doesn't comply\n\nAfter I answer each one, tell me if I'm correct and explain why.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: The AI creates scenario after scenario. Students test themselves, get immediate feedback, and can continue until they achieve mastery. Unlike a textbook with 5 practice problems, this provides unlimited practice.\nKey feature: AI adapts. If student gets several wrong, AI can simplify. If student masters basic scenarios, AI can make them more complex.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm learning to identify different types of workplace conflict (task\nconflict, relationship conflict, process conflict).\n\nCreate 8 brief workplace scenarios. For each one, I'll identify the type\nof conflict and suggest an appropriate intervention approach.\n\nAfter each scenario, provide feedback on my classification and intervention\nsuggestion. If I'm wrong, explain why and what I missed.\n\nMake the scenarios progressively more complex—start easy, end with\nambiguous situations where multiple interpretations are valid.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: Progressive difficulty builds confidence and competence. Students move from obvious cases to nuanced judgment calls.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Prompt:\nCreate a practice exam for me based on the topics we've covered in my\nWorkplace Conflict Resolution unit.\n\nInclude:\n- 10 multiple choice questions (4 options each)\n- 3 short-answer questions (each requiring 150-200 word response)\n- 1 case study with 4 analysis questions\n\nTopics to cover:\n- Conflict theory (Thomas-Kilmann, interest-based bargaining)\n- Investigation processes\n- Mediation approaches\n- Legal requirements (procedural fairness, natural justice)\n\nAfter I complete the exam, grade my answers and provide detailed feedback\non what I got right/wrong and why.\nWhat Happens: Students can generate multiple practice exams with different questions each time. They enter the real exam having practiced extensively.\n\n\n\n\nLecturer Prompt (to create remediation resource):\nI have students who struggled with understanding procedural fairness in\nworkplace investigations. Many think it just means \"being nice\" and don't\nunderstand the specific legal requirements.\n\nCreate a 10-question diagnostic quiz that tests whether students understand:\n1. The right to be informed of allegations\n2. The right to respond to allegations\n3. The requirement for impartial decision-making\n4. The requirement to consider the response before deciding\n5. The right to representation/support\n\nFor each question, use a scenario format. After each answer, provide\nimmediate teaching feedback explaining the principle, not just whether\nthey're right or wrong.\n\nGenerate the quiz.\nWhat You Get: A targeted remediation tool that teaches while testing. Students who failed your assessment can use this to identify and fix their knowledge gaps.\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Recommended Practice (Ungraded)\nIn your unit outline: &gt; “Before each assessment, I recommend using AI to generate practice questions and scenarios. Spend 30-60 minutes testing yourself until you feel confident. This is optional but strongly encouraged.”\nOption 2: Required Pre-Assessment Activity (Low Stakes)\n\n“Before the Week 8 exam, complete a self-generated practice test (minimum 20 questions). Submit a screenshot showing completion and a 100-word reflection: What did you learn from this practice? What areas do you still need to review?”\n\nWorth 5% of final grade—graded on completion and reflection quality, not on how many they got right.\nOption 3: Study Group Activity\n\n“In your study groups, use AI to generate practice scenarios. Each person generates 5 scenarios and tests the group. Discuss answers and explanations together.”\n\nCombines AI efficiency with peer learning.\n\n\n\n\nImportant: This technique is for practice, not for graded assessment.\nWhy? - Students can regenerate until they get “good” questions they already know answers to - AI-generated questions lack the rigor of carefully designed exam questions - Students need to struggle and make mistakes in low-stakes practice\nThe value: Unlimited, personalised practice that builds confidence and competence before high-stakes assessment.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Student Prompt:\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. performance management\nvs. legitimate reasonable management action.\n\nCreate scenarios for me to classify. After each one:\n- If I get it right, make the next scenario more nuanced and ambiguous\n- If I get it wrong, make the next scenario clearer and more obvious\n- Continue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult/ambiguous cases in a row\n\nTrack my progress and tell me when I've achieved mastery.\n\nBegin.\nThis creates a personalised learning path—AI adjusts difficulty based on student performance.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional practice is limited by: - Finite textbook questions - Lecturer time to create practice materials - Inability to provide immediate feedback at scale\nAI removes these constraints: - Infinite practice scenarios - Instant generation - Immediate feedback - Adaptive difficulty\nResult: Students can practice until they achieve mastery, not until they run out of practice problems.\n\n\n\n\nWhile true adaptive AI systems require technical infrastructure, students can manually create adaptive difficulty through smart prompting:\nStudent Prompt: Self-Directed Progression\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. legitimate performance\nmanagement vs. reasonable management action.\n\nGenerate scenarios for me to classify. After I answer each one, tell me if\nI'm correct.\n\nTrack my performance. When I get 8 out of 10 correct, automatically make\nthe next batch of scenarios more complex and ambiguous. When I get fewer\nthan 5 out of 10 correct, make the next batch clearer and more obvious.\n\nContinue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult, ambiguous cases in a row.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1 at medium difficulty.\nWhat This Achieves: - Student-controlled difficulty progression - Mastery-based advancement - Builds confidence through appropriate challenge - No technical setup required—just good prompting\nTeaching Tip:\nEncourage students to track their progress: &gt; “Before your next exam, use AI to practice until you achieve 90% accuracy on hard scenarios. Submit a screenshot showing your progression and a 100-word reflection on what you learned.”\nThis creates accountability without requiring sophisticated adaptive systems."

    "text": "Students consult multiple AI “experts” with different theoretical or professional perspectives on the same HR problem, then synthesize the competing advice into a strategic recommendation.\n\n\n\nHR problems rarely have single “correct” answers. They exist at the intersection of psychology, law, business strategy, and ethics. This technique forces students to consider legitimate but competing perspectives and make informed choices about priorities and trade-offs.\n\n\n\nI need to address high turnover in our sales department (35% annual turnover;\nindustry average is 18%). This is affecting team morale, increasing\nrecruitment costs, and impacting customer relationships.\n\nCreate three expert personas who will each analyse this problem from their\nprofessional perspective:\n\n**Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist**\nFocus on: Employee motivation, job satisfaction, workplace culture, team\ndynamics, psychological contracts\n\n**Expert 2: Compensation & Benefits Specialist**\nFocus on: Pay equity, market competitiveness, incentive structures, total\nrewards, cost-benefit analysis\n\n**Expert 3: Talent Management Strategist**\nFocus on: Career development, succession planning, retention programs,\nemployee value proposition, organisational capability\n\nHave each expert independently provide:\n1. Their diagnosis of why turnover is high (from their perspective)\n2. Their recommended intervention strategy\n3. Potential risks or limitations of their recommended approach\n4. What data they would need to validate their hypothesis\n\nAfter all three experts have provided their analysis, I will synthesize\ntheir recommendations and develop my own strategic recommendation.\n\nBegin with Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist.\n\n\n\nThe AI creates three distinct voices:\nOrganizational Psychologist: &gt; “The 35% turnover suggests a breakdown in psychological contract or poor person-organization fit. Sales roles are inherently stressful, but this level suggests systemic issues—possibly unrealistic targets, poor management relationships, or lack of autonomy. I recommend: (1) Conduct stay/exit interview analysis focusing on psychological factors, (2) Assess manager-employee relationship quality, (3) Review goal-setting processes…”\nCompensation Specialist: &gt; “At 35% turnover, you’re likely seeing pay inequity or uncompetitive base/commission structures. Sales talent is mobile and market-driven. I recommend: (1) Conduct compensation benchmarking against competitors, (2) Analyse pay dispersion within the team, (3) Review commission structures for fairness and achievability…”\nTalent Management Strategist: &gt; “High turnover in sales suggests limited growth opportunities or unclear career paths. Top performers leave when they plateau. I recommend: (1) Map career progression pathways, (2) Implement mentoring for high-potentials, (3) Create lateral development opportunities…”\n\n\n\nAfter receiving all three perspectives, students must:\n\nCompare and Contrast:\n\nWhere do the experts agree?\nWhere do they conflict?\nWhich diagnosis seems most plausible given the evidence?\n\nSynthesize:\n\n“If I could only implement one intervention, which would have the most impact?”\n“How could I combine elements from multiple recommendations?”\n“What’s the minimum viable intervention that addresses multiple root causes?”\n\nJustify with Theory:\n\n“Which HR theory best explains my chosen approach?” (e.g., Herzberg’s two-factor theory, social exchange theory, expectancy theory)\n“What evidence would I need to collect to validate my choice?”\n\nAcknowledge Trade-offs:\n\n“What am I deprioritizing by choosing this approach?”\n“What are the risks if my diagnosis is wrong?”\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation 1: Policy Design\nThree experts debate a proposed \"Bring Your Own Device\" policy:\n- IT Security Officer (focus: data protection, cybersecurity)\n- HR Manager (focus: employee experience, equity, privacy)\n- CFO (focus: cost savings, business case, ROI)\n\nEach argues for their priorities. Student must design a policy that\nbalances all three perspectives.\nVariation 2: Ethical Dilemma\nThree experts analyse whether to implement mandatory return-to-office:\n- Employee Relations Specialist (focus: morale, retention, fairness)\n- Operations Manager (focus: productivity, collaboration, efficiency)\n- Legal Counsel (focus: contractual obligations, discrimination risk, WHS)\n\nStudent must recommend a policy that is ethical, legal, and operationally sound.\nVariation 3: Change Management\nThree experts advise on implementing AI resume screening:\n- Diversity & Inclusion Officer (focus: algorithmic bias, equity)\n- Recruitment Lead (focus: efficiency, candidate experience)\n- Risk & Compliance Manager (focus: legal compliance, audit trails)\n\nStudent must design an implementation plan that addresses all concerns.\n\n\n\nAssignment: Multi-Expert Consultation Report\nStudent Requirements: 1. Generate consultation with 3 experts on an assigned HR problem 2. Submit full transcript of expert advice 3. Write 1000-word synthesis report including: - Summary of each expert’s position - Analysis of agreements and conflicts - Your strategic recommendation with justification - Theoretical framework supporting your choice - Implementation risks and mitigation strategies\nWhat You’re Assessing: - Ability to understand multiple valid perspectives - Synthesis and integration skills - Strategic decision-making under ambiguity - Application of HR theory to justify choices - Recognition of trade-offs and constraints\n\n\n\nMost business teaching presents one “correct” approach. But professional practice requires navigating competing legitimate perspectives.\nThis technique teaches: - No single expert has the complete answer - Good business decisions balance multiple priorities and perspectives - Strategic thinking means choosing which perspective to prioritize when - Justification matters more than the specific choice - Real problems require synthesis, not just analysis\n\n\n\nExpert Panel works brilliantly with:\nPros and Cons (Technique 2): &gt; “After consulting the expert panel, use the Pros and Cons technique to evaluate each expert’s recommended intervention systematically.”\nDebating (Technique 5): &gt; “Have the three experts debate each other’s recommendations. Then you arbitrate and make the final decision.”\nRole Play (Technique 4): &gt; “After developing your strategy based on expert consultation, role-play presenting it to a skeptical stakeholder (CFO, union rep, CEO) and defend your choices.”"

    "title": "Managing Context with AI: Why It Matters and How to Do It Well",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most underrated skills in working with AI is managing context—the information you feed to an AI system and how you structure your conversations.\nThink of context like the working memory of the AI. Unlike humans, who can maintain context across days or weeks of conversation, AI has specific limitations:\n\nLimited attention span: Conversations have maximum lengths before older information gets “forgotten”\nToken limits: Every token (word fragment) used in conversation—both input and output—counts against the model’s capacity\nOutput token competition: When you ask an AI to do multiple things at once, it must divide its output tokens among all the tasks, often producing shallow results\nHallucination risk: As conversations grow longer, the risk of AI “making up” information (hallucinating) increases\n\nThe good news? Understanding and managing context is a learnable skill that directly improves output quality, saves time, and reduces errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens: You have a great conversation going. You’ve asked 15 follow-up questions, refined ideas, built on earlier outputs. Then you ask question 16, and AI gives you a response that contradicts something from question 3.\nWhy: The AI’s working memory is limited. While it can technically “see” the entire conversation, older information becomes less salient (less in focus) as the conversation grows. AI attention diminishes with distance.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: You ask AI to “redesign this unit, create a rubric, write student instructions, and design an assessment.” You get four things, but each is shallow because AI divided its output tokens four ways.\nWhy: Every model has a maximum output token limit (typically 1,000–4,000 tokens). If you ask for 4 things, you get roughly 250–1,000 tokens per thing. Quality suffers.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: As conversations get longer, AI becomes more likely to “confidently generate false information”—fabricating citations, making up examples, or misremembering earlier statements.\nWhy: Longer conversations increase uncertainty and complexity in the model’s reasoning. It’s trying to track more information and making more inferential leaps.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: You close the chat window. Next week, you want to continue the work. You paste your earlier thinking into a new chat, but AI doesn’t have the full conversation history, so it repeats earlier points or misses nuance.\nWhy: Each new conversation starts fresh. The AI has no memory of the previous session unless you explicitly provide it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: Before diving into work, ask AI to help you structure the task.\nWhy it works: - Distributes output tokens efficiently (each step gets focus) - Reduces hallucination risk (smaller scope per prompt) - Gives you a plan to follow (more organised) - Lets you quality-check each step before moving forward\n\n\nInstead of asking all at once: &gt; “Redesign my unit on data literacy. Create new learning outcomes, design assessments, write student instructions, create a rubric, and draft a unit description.”\nBreak it into steps—first step, ask for a plan: &gt; “I’m redesigning a unit on data literacy for 2nd-year business students. Help me create a structured plan for this redesign. What are the key steps I should follow? List them in order with what we should accomplish at each step.”\n[AI gives you a plan: outcomes → assessments → instructions → rubric → description]\nThen work through the plan one step at a time:\nStep 1: &gt; “Let’s start with step 1. Here are my current outcomes: [paste]. Which are clear and assessable? Which need work? Suggest 2–3 revised outcomes focused on authentic data literacy.”\n[Get focused, high-quality outcomes]\nStep 2: &gt; “Good. Now for step 2: suggest three assessment approaches that would test those outcomes. For each, explain what students do and why it tests data literacy.”\n[Get focused assessment options]\nAnd so on.\n\n\n\nCreate a research plan first: &gt; “I’m designing a study on student retention. Help me outline the key steps: research question, variables, methods, data collection, analysis, and writing. What’s the logical order? What questions should I answer in each phase?”\nThen tackle one phase at a time: &gt; “Phase 1: Research question. I’m interested in belonging, confidence, and persistence. Help me craft a specific research question that addresses these. Make it answerable.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: Ask for one main thing per prompt, not multiple things.\nWhy it works: - Each output gets full attention and token allocation - Quality increases (you get depth, not breadth) - Easier to review and iterate on one thing - Reduces the cognitive load on the model\n\n\nPoor: (Asking for too much at once) &gt; “Write a lesson plan for data visualization. Include learning outcomes, 3 activities, assessment rubric, and student handout.”\nOutput: Shallow. Each element is skeletal.\nBetter: (One task per prompt)\nPrompt 1: &gt; “Design 3 activities for teaching data visualization that move from basic to complex. For each, describe what students do and what they’ll learn.”\nPrompt 2 (after reviewing): &gt; “Now create an assessment rubric for evaluating students’ data visualizations. Include 4 criteria, with descriptions of excellent/proficient/developing for each.”\nPrompt 3 (after reviewing): &gt; “Turn that rubric and the activity descriptions into a one-page student handout. Include: what they’re learning, why it matters, the activities, success criteria, and how to get help.”\nOutput: Deep. Each element is thoughtful and specific.\n\n\n\nSometimes asking for multiple outputs makes sense:\n\nComparative tasks: “Show me 3 different ways to explain photosynthesis to 9th graders. What are the trade-offs of each?”\nStructured formats: “Create an outline with: learning outcomes, key concepts, and 2 discussion questions”\nQuick iterations: “Now make that more concise / more detailed / more critical”\n\nThe key: Are the outputs relatively equal in scope and complexity? If yes, ask for multiple. If one task is much bigger than others, split them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: When asking for multiple things, specify output size/structure upfront.\nThis helps AI divide tokens wisely.\n\n\nWithout constraints: &gt; “What are the pros and cons of portfolio assessment vs. exam-based assessment?”\nAI might spend 70% of tokens on portfolio and 30% on exams, or get wordy on both.\nWith constraints: &gt; “Compare portfolio assessment vs. exam-based assessment. For each, provide:- 2 key advantages- 2 key limitations- Best for (one sentence)each section to 3–4 sentences max.”\nAI knows exactly how to divide tokens. Output is balanced and concise.\n\n\n\nI need [specific output type]. Provide:\n\n1. [First thing] - [length/format]\n2. [Second thing] - [length/format]\n3. [Third thing] - [length/format]\n\nKeep total output under [X words/lines]. Prioritize clarity over completeness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: Use separate conversations for separate projects or major topic shifts.\nWhy it works: - Shorter conversations = less hallucination risk - Easier to find earlier outputs (scrolling back is simpler) - AI stays focused on one topic - Cleaner record-keeping (export or save by topic)\n\n\n\nTopic shift: Finished unit redesign? Start a new conversation for assessment analysis.\nMajor context change: Moving from teaching to research? New conversation.\nLength: Conversation getting very long (50+ exchanges)? Consider summarizing and moving to a new one.\nDifferent AI tool: Using Claude for one task and ChatGPT for another? Keep them separate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIterative work on the same project (refining, revising)\nRelated follow-ups (asking for adaptations of earlier output)\nBuilding on previous steps (multi-step workflows)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: When a conversation gets long, ask AI to summarize what you’ve accomplished, then start fresh in a new conversation.\nWhy it works: - Resets the “attention freshness” (AI isn’t tracking 30+ old exchanges) - Gives you a clean document of what you’ve done - Reduces hallucination in the new conversation - Allows you to build on work without repeating context\n\n\nIn the long conversation, when it feels unwieldy:\nPrompt: &gt; “We’ve been working on [project name] for a while. Can you summarize what we’ve accomplished so far? Include:- What problem/task we started with- Key decisions we made- What we’ve created/designed so far- What still needs to be doneit concise but complete—something I can copy and paste into a new conversation to continue.”\n[AI provides a summary]\nCopy that summary. Then:\n\nStart a new conversation\nPaste the summary at the beginning\nAdd: “I’m continuing this work. Let’s move forward with [next step].”\nContinue from there\n\nExample handoff:\n\n“We’ve been designing a capstone project for business students. We’ve created:- 3 learning outcomes (attached)- Project brief (attached)- Assessment rubric (attached)’s left: student instructions and facilitator notes. Let’s start with student instructions. Here’s the context: [paste].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: Don’t assume AI remembers or understands implicit context. State it clearly.\nPoor context: &gt; “How should I handle this in class?”\n(Missing: What is “this”? What’s the class? What’s the issue? What’s your teaching style?)\nGood context: &gt; “I teach critical thinking to 40 business students (mix of 2nd and 3rd year, variable engagement). One student dominates discussions while others stay quiet. How can I manage this without embarrassing the dominant student or discouraging the quiet ones?”\nBetter context (if continuing earlier work): &gt; “Remember we’re designing a discussion-based unit on business ethics. We wanted to encourage broader participation. One challenge: one student always dominates. How can we structure the discussion activity to naturally encourage quieter students to speak?”\n\n\n\nWho: Who are the students/audience?\nWhat: What’s the specific task or problem?\nWhy: Why does it matter?\nConstraints: What are the limitations (time, resources, class size)?\nStyle: What’s your teaching/working style? What’s worked before?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle: When you have multiple similar tasks (e.g., “write 5 discussion questions”), batch them efficiently.\nPoor approach: &gt; “Write a discussion question on topic A.” &gt; [Review] &gt; “Write a discussion question on topic B.” &gt; [Review] &gt; [Repeat 3 more times]\nThis takes 5+ exchanges and repeats setup context each time.\nBetter approach:\nPrompt: &gt; “I need 5 discussion questions for a unit on organisational leadership. They should:- Progress from basic understanding to critical analysis- Each take 5–10 minutes of discussion- Spark respectful debate (not yes/no questions): 1) Leadership styles, 2) Ethical decision-making, 3) Team conflict, 4) Change management, 5) Inclusive leadership.all 5 questions with a note about why each one works.”\nSingle exchange. AI understands the pattern. Higher quality.\nThen iterate once: &gt; “These are good. Now adapt question 3 and 5 to be more accessible for international students who might be less familiar with Western leadership literature.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMistake\nWhat Goes Wrong\nFix\n\n\n\n\nAsking for 10 things at once\nOutput is shallow; tokens split 10 ways\nBreak into 2–3 prompts, one task per prompt\n\n\nVague task description\nAI misunderstands what you want\nAdd explicit context: who, what, why, constraints\n\n\nLeaving the conversation open indefinitely\nHallucination risk increases; conversation becomes unwieldy\nStart new conversation every 30–50 exchanges\n\n\nNot specifying output format\nAI guesses format; may not match your needs\nSay “bullet points,” “3 paragraphs,” “table,” etc.\n\n\nAsking “what am I missing?”\nAI may invent things that don’t apply\nBe specific: “What am I missing for [specific context]?”\n\n\nForgetting to review outputs\nErrors and hallucinations slip through\nAlways quality-check, especially for facts/citations\n\n\nPasting entire documents without context\nAI doesn’t know what you want it to focus on\nAdd a framing sentence: “Here’s my unit outline.

    "text": "One of the most underrated skills in working with AI is managing context—the information you feed to an AI system and how you structure your conversations.\nThink of context like the working memory of the AI. Unlike humans, who can maintain context across days or weeks of conversation, AI has specific limitations:\n\nLimited attention span: Conversations have maximum lengths before older information gets “forgotten”\nToken limits: Every token (word fragment) used in conversation—both input and output—counts against the model’s capacity\nOutput token competition: When you ask an AI to do multiple things at once, it must divide its output tokens among all the tasks, often producing shallow results\nHallucination risk: As conversations grow longer, the risk of AI “making up” information (hallucinating) increases\n\nThe good news? Understanding and managing context is a learnable skill that directly improves output quality, saves time, and reduces errors."

    "text": "What happens: You have a great conversation going. You’ve asked 15 follow-up questions, refined ideas, built on earlier outputs. Then you ask question 16, and AI gives you a response that contradicts something from question 3.\nWhy: The AI’s working memory is limited. While it can technically “see” the entire conversation, older information becomes less salient (less in focus) as the conversation grows. AI attention diminishes with distance.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: You ask AI to “redesign this unit, create a rubric, write student instructions, and design an assessment.” You get four things, but each is shallow because AI divided its output tokens four ways.\nWhy: Every model has a maximum output token limit (typically 1,000–4,000 tokens). If you ask for 4 things, you get roughly 250–1,000 tokens per thing. Quality suffers.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: As conversations get longer, AI becomes more likely to “confidently generate false information”—fabricating citations, making up examples, or misremembering earlier statements.\nWhy: Longer conversations increase uncertainty and complexity in the model’s reasoning. It’s trying to track more information and making more inferential leaps.\n\n\n\nWhat happens: You close the chat window. Next week, you want to continue the work. You paste your earlier thinking into a new chat, but AI doesn’t have the full conversation history, so it repeats earlier points or misses nuance.\nWhy: Each new conversation starts fresh. The AI has no memory of the previous session unless you explicitly provide it."

    "text": "The Principle: Before diving into work, ask AI to help you structure the task.\nWhy it works: - Distributes output tokens efficiently (each step gets focus) - Reduces hallucination risk (smaller scope per prompt) - Gives you a plan to follow (more organised) - Lets you quality-check each step before moving forward\n\n\nInstead of asking all at once: &gt; “Redesign my unit on data literacy. Create new learning outcomes, design assessments, write student instructions, create a rubric, and draft a unit description.”\nBreak it into steps—first step, ask for a plan: &gt; “I’m redesigning a unit on data literacy for 2nd-year business students. Help me create a structured plan for this redesign. What are the key steps I should follow? List them in order with what we should accomplish at each step.”\n[AI gives you a plan: outcomes → assessments → instructions → rubric → description]\nThen work through the plan one step at a time:\nStep 1: &gt; “Let’s start with step 1. Here are my current outcomes: [paste]. Which are clear and assessable? Which need work? Suggest 2–3 revised outcomes focused on authentic data literacy.”\n[Get focused, high-quality outcomes]\nStep 2: &gt; “Good. Now for step 2: suggest three assessment approaches that would test those outcomes. For each, explain what students do and why it tests data literacy.”\n[Get focused assessment options]\nAnd so on.\n\n\n\nCreate a research plan first: &gt; “I’m designing a study on student retention. Help me outline the key steps: research question, variables, methods, data collection, analysis, and writing. What’s the logical order? What questions should I answer in each phase?”\nThen tackle one phase at a time: &gt; “Phase 1: Research question. I’m interested in belonging, confidence, and persistence.

    "title": "Cognitive Prompting in Education",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Cognitive Prompting in Education: A New Pedagogical Frontier\nCognitive prompting represents a fundamental shift in how educators approach AI integration—moving beyond simple content generation to intentional instructional design that enhances cognitive development and deeper learning.\n\nCore Philosophy & Vision\nKey Takeaway: AI prompting is not a technological shortcut but a “new pedagogical frontier” that enhances intentional teaching, learning design, and deeper cognitive engagement. The focus shifts from “What can AI produce?” to “How can AI enhance cognitive development?”—prioritizing analysis, synthesis, reflection, and metacognition over mere content creation.\nAnalogy: Cognitive prompting is like learning to conduct an orchestra. Rather than just asking musicians to play notes (basic AI queries), the conductor (educator) learns to shape the performance through intentional cues, timing, and emphasis (sophisticated prompts) that bring out the depth and emotion of the music (cognitive development). The conductor’s artistry lies not in playing instruments, but in eliciting the most meaningful performance from each musician.\n\n\nThe “Prompting as Pedagogy” Model\nKey Takeaway: This framework aligns AI prompts with Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb’s Depth of Knowledge to match cognitive rigor, transforming prompting from a technical trick into an intentional instructional move requiring learning theory, design principles, and content expertise. The model evolves based on faculty and student feedback, ensuring practical relevance.\nAnalogy: If traditional AI use was like using a calculator for basic arithmetic, cognitive prompting is like using advanced mathematical modeling software. Both tools compute, but the latter requires deep understanding of mathematical principles to design models that solve complex problems and reveal insights beyond simple calculations.\n\n\nImplementation & Educational Impact\nKey Takeaway: Effective implementation requires capacity building through ethical, meaningful integration and professional development. Educators need structures, not just tools, to use AI effectively. Prompting fluency emerges as a core digital competency—essentially teaching AI interaction as a “second language” for student success in an AI-driven world.\nAnalogy: Teaching cognitive prompting is like teaching a foreign language. Students don’t just learn vocabulary (basic commands); they learn grammar, cultural context, and conversational nuance (strategic prompting) that allows them to express complex ideas and navigate sophisticated interactions. Without this deeper understanding, they’re limited to tourist-level communication.\n\n\nFuture Challenges & Human-Centric Balance\nKey Takeaway: As LLMs advance, prompting sophistication will require ongoing professional development. The critical challenge is maintaining human connection and emotional intelligence as central to education, avoiding the devaluation of the human element while leveraging AI’s efficiency. Institutions need reproducibility frameworks and clear documentation for AI-driven educational practices.\nAnalogy: The evolution of cognitive prompting is like the development of aviation. Early pilots (basic AI users) could handle simple flights in good weather. Modern pilots (advanced prompters) must understand complex systems, weather patterns, and emergency procedures (sophisticated prompting strategies) to navigate challenging conditions safely. However, no matter how advanced the autopilot becomes, passengers still need human pilots for judgment, empathy, and critical decision-making during turbulence.\n\n💡 Wisdom in a Nutshell: “Prompting isn’t about getting better AI responses—it’s about thinking more intentionally about our goals, methods, and how we design learning for students.” This mindset shift transforms AI from a tool into a catalyst for pedagogical innovation."

    "title": "Using AI to Help You Use AI: Meta-Skills for Learning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here’s something remarkable: AI can teach you how to use itself.\nThis is fundamentally different from traditional tools. Excel can’t teach you how to use Excel. PowerPoint can’t guide you through using PowerPoint. Email can’t help you email better.\nBut AI can.\nWhy? Because AI can: - Ask you diagnostic questions - Understand context about your role and challenges - Evaluate its own recommendations - Refine advice based on your feedback - Serve as a patient, tireless thinking partner\nThis creates a unique opportunity: You can use AI to discover how to use AI better.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the key: Instead of asking AI to directly solve a problem, you can ask AI to help you figure out how to ask AI for help.\nExample comparison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect Approach\nMeta Approach\n\n\n\n\n“How should I answer this question?”\n“What’s the best way to frame this question for an AI so I get useful help?”\n\n\n“Give me strategies for using AI in my teaching.”\n“Ask me questions to understand my teaching context, then recommend both obvious and unexpected ways I could use AI.”\n\n\n“How do I improve my workflow?”\n“Interview me about my role and responsibilities, then suggest AI tools and strategies I might not have considered.”\n\n\n\nThe meta approach is more powerful because AI asks you clarifying questions first, learns your context, and then provides recommendations tailored to your actual situation—not generic advice for a hypothetical educator or professional.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a prompt you can use immediately. Copy it, paste it into your AI tool of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.), and adapt it to your role:\nYou're an AI expert consultant. I'd love your help understanding how I could\nbetter use AI in my work.\n\nPlease ask me one question at a time. I'll answer, then you'll ask the next\nquestion. Keep asking until you understand:\n- My role and responsibilities\n- My main workflows and challenges\n- My key objectives and KPIs (what matters for success)\n- My constraints (time, resources, skills, institutional requirements)\n\nOnce you have enough context, provide TWO types of recommendations:\n1. Obvious opportunities: Clear, straightforward AI applications\n   (the low-hanging fruit most people think of)\n2. Non-obvious opportunities: Unexpected or creative uses of AI I might not\n   have considered\n\nFormat your recommendations clearly with implementation tips for each.\nThat’s it. Paste that prompt and start answering questions. You’re about to have one of the most useful conversations about AI you could possibly have.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you ask AI to interview you before making recommendations, several things happen:\n\n\nAI doesn’t know anything about you initially. By asking sequential questions, it builds a comprehensive picture of: - Your discipline and teaching/research/operational context - Your students, colleagues, or stakeholders - Your constraints and resources - What success looks like for you\nThis context is invaluable. Generic AI advice for “educators” doesn’t account for the fact that you teach engineering capstones, or manage compliance for a large faculty, or support early-career researchers. Context changes everything.\n\n\n\nAI tends to suggest obvious applications first (automating grading, generating ideas, answering questions). Those are valuable, but they’re predictable.\nBy asking for both obvious and non-obvious recommendations, you push AI to think more creatively: - Obvious: Use AI to generate discussion questions for your seminar - Non-obvious: Use AI as a “skeptical peer reviewer” to critique your teaching materials before students see them - Non-obvious: Use AI to help you understand common misconceptions your students hold (based on their questions and assignments) - Non-obvious: Use AI to design assessments that are harder for AI to cheat on\nThe non-obvious ideas are often where the real value lies.\n\n\n\nAI is remarkably good at evaluating its own suggestions. When it generates a list of recommendations, it can: - Assess which are most feasible for your context - Identify trade-offs - Refine implementation strategies - Suggest variations or combinations\nThis creates a feedback loop where recommendations get better through iteration.\n\n\n\nUnlike reading a guide or taking a course, this is a conversation. You’re not passively receiving advice—you’re actively shaping it by: - Answering questions honestly - Pushing back on ideas that don’t fit - Asking follow-up questions - Exploring implications\nThe back-and-forth is where deep learning happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a simplified example of how the conversation might unfold:\n\n\n[You paste the consultation prompt above]\n\n\n\n\n“Thanks for that. Let’s start with the basics. What’s your primary role? Are you an educator, researcher, administrator, or something else? And what’s your discipline or field?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’m a teaching coordinator in the business faculty. I manage unit approvals, coordinate teaching support across 15 units, and help faculty integrate new teaching approaches.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“That’s helpful context. What’s your biggest pain point right now? What’s taking up most of your time or causing the most frustration?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Definitely the administrative stuff. Tracking who needs what support, scheduling meetings, writing emails summarising policies to faculty who haven’t read them, managing compliance documentation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I hear you. Now, thinking about your faculty members—what’s one thing they struggle with that you think AI could help them with? And what’s one thing you struggle with in supporting them?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Faculty struggle with writing clear learning outcomes and designing assessments. And I struggle with translating compliance requirements into plain language they actually understand.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Perfect—those are solvable with AI. One more: What would success look like for you? If you had more time back and your faculty felt better supported, what would change?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’d have time for strategic work instead of just admin. And faculty would feel confident designing assessments without constantly asking me questions.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Okay, I have enough context. Here are my recommendations:\n\n\nOBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI to draft plain-language policy summaries for faculty - Use AI to help faculty write learning outcomes (with your review) - Use AI to generate assessment design templates\n\n\nNON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI to analyse faculty questions/emails and identify common gaps in understanding, then create targeted guidance - Use AI as a ‘quality check’ tool: paste a unit outline and ask it to flag compliance risks or unclear learning outcomes - Use AI to design a simple chatbot or FAQ that answers routine faculty questions about policies - Use AI to help you create training materials that explain ‘why’ policies exist, not just ‘what’ they are”\n\n\nSee the difference? The AI didn’t just rattle off generic suggestions. It understood your specific role, constraints, and challenges. The recommendations are contextual and actionable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis guide is foundational because it helps you discover your own starting point. After using AI to interview you, you might then:\n\nDive deeper into specific techniques:\n\nIf AI recommends using prompts with students, explore the Seven Essential Techniques\nIf AI suggests using AI for analysis and reporting, explore C.R.A.F.T. Prompting and Prompt Chaining\nIf you’re new to AI generally, start with What is AI? and What are LLMs?\n\nUse AI to help you understand other guides:\n\n“I’m reading a guide about prompt chaining. Can you ask me questions about my use case, then explain how prompt chaining would help?”\n“I don’t fully understand the C.R.A.F.T. framework. Can you interview me about a specific prompt I want to write, then help me structure it using CRAFT?”\n\nReturn to this guide periodically:\n\nYour role, context, and goals change. Run this consultation quarterly\nEach time, you’ll discover new opportunities you’re ready for now that you weren’t before\nThis keeps your AI strategy aligned with your evolving priorities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your role, you might adapt the consultation prompt:\n\n\nYou're an AI expert in pedagogical technology. Ask me questions about my teaching\n(students, discipline, learning goals, constraints) so you can recommend both\nobvious and non-obvious ways to use AI to enhance student learning without\nreplacing authentic work.\n\n\n\nYou're an AI expert in research methodology. Ask me about my research area,\nmethods, and challenges. Then recommend both obvious and non-obvious ways AI\ncould support my research process (not the research itself, but the process).\n\n\n\nYou're an AI expert in academic operations. Ask me about my role (responsibilities,\nworkflows, stakeholders, success metrics). Then recommend both obvious and\nnon-obvious ways AI could help me work more strategically and reduce administrative burden.\n\n\n\nYou're an AI expert in helping people discover their relationship with AI.\nAsk me questions about my work, my goals, what frustrates me, what excites me.\nThen recommend how I could start experimenting with AI in ways that matter to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s really happening when you ask AI to interview you:\nAI acts as a mirror for your own thinking.\nBy asking clarifying questions, AI forces you to articulate: - What you actually do (vs. what you think you do) - What matters most (vs. what’s just urgent) - What’s possible (vs. what feels impossible) - What you haven’t tried (because you didn’t know it was possible)\nOften, the value of this conversation isn’t the AI’s recommendations—it’s the clarity you gain about your own work by having to explain it.\nPeople report things like: - “I didn’t realise how much time I was spending on [task] until the AI asked about it” - “Talking through my role, I realised I could combine AI with [other tool] in a way I’d never considered” - “Just articulating my challenges to the AI helped me see a solution on my own”\nThe AI is a thinking partner, not a replacement for your thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t try to impress the AI with polished answers\nThe more honest you are about constraints and challenges, the better the recommendations\n“We have no budget,” “I don’t have time to learn new tools,” “My institution is skeptical of AI”—these are valuable context\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter getting recommendations, ask:\n\n“How would I actually implement the non-obvious ones?”\n“Which of these could I start with this week?”\n“What are the risks or drawbacks?”\n“How would I know if this is working?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick ONE obvious and ONE non-obvious recommendation\nTry them for a week or two\nReport back to AI: “I tried [recommendation]. Here’s what happened…”\nAI will help you iterate toward what works\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t a one-time conversation\nYour context changes; your needs evolve\nRun this consultation again in 3–6 months\nEach time you’ll be ready for different ideas\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you discover something useful, share it with colleagues\n“I asked AI to help me discover how to use AI, and it suggested [X].

    "text": "When you ask AI to interview you before making recommendations, several things happen:\n\n\nAI doesn’t know anything about you initially. By asking sequential questions, it builds a comprehensive picture of: - Your discipline and teaching/research/operational context - Your students, colleagues, or stakeholders - Your constraints and resources - What success looks like for you\nThis context is invaluable. Generic AI advice for “educators” doesn’t account for the fact that you teach engineering capstones, or manage compliance for a large faculty, or support early-career researchers. Context changes everything.\n\n\n\nAI tends to suggest obvious applications first (automating grading, generating ideas, answering questions). Those are valuable, but they’re predictable.\nBy asking for both obvious and non-obvious recommendations, you push AI to think more creatively: - Obvious: Use AI to generate discussion questions for your seminar - Non-obvious: Use AI as a “skeptical peer reviewer” to critique your teaching materials before students see them - Non-obvious: Use AI to help you understand common misconceptions your students hold (based on their questions and assignments) - Non-obvious: Use AI to design assessments that are harder for AI to cheat on\nThe non-obvious ideas are often where the real value lies.\n\n\n\nAI is remarkably good at evaluating its own suggestions. When it generates a list of recommendations, it can: - Assess which are most feasible for your context - Identify trade-offs - Refine implementation strategies - Suggest variations or combinations\nThis creates a feedback loop where recommendations get better through iteration.\n\n\n\nUnlike reading a guide or taking a course, this is a conversation. You’re not passively receiving advice—you’re actively shaping it by: - Answering questions honestly - Pushing back on ideas that don’t fit - Asking follow-up questions - Exploring implications\nThe back-and-forth is where deep learning happens."

What’s your primary role? Are you an educator, researcher, administrator, or something else? And what’s your discipline or field?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’m a teaching coordinator in the business faculty. I manage unit approvals, coordinate teaching support across 15 units, and help faculty integrate new teaching approaches.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“That’s helpful context. What’s your biggest pain point right now? What’s taking up most of your time or causing the most frustration?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Definitely the administrative stuff. Tracking who needs what support, scheduling meetings, writing emails summarising policies to faculty who haven’t read them, managing compliance documentation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I hear you. Now, thinking about your faculty members—what’s one thing they struggle with that you think AI could help them with? And what’s one thing you struggle with in supporting them?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Faculty struggle with writing clear learning outcomes and designing assessments. And I struggle with translating compliance requirements into plain language they actually understand.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Perfect—those are solvable with AI. One more: What would success look like for you? If you had more time back and your faculty felt better supported, what would change?”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’d have time for strategic work instead of just admin. And faculty would feel confident designing assessments without constantly asking me questions.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Okay, I have enough context. Here are my recommendations:\n\n\nOBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI to draft plain-language policy summaries for faculty - Use AI to help faculty write learning outcomes (with your review) - Use AI to generate assessment design templates\n\n\nNON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI to analyse faculty questions/emails and identify common gaps in understanding, then create targeted guidance - Use AI as a ‘quality check’ tool: paste a unit outline and ask it to flag compliance risks or unclear learning outcomes - Use AI to design a simple chatbot or FAQ that answers routine faculty questions about policies - Use AI to help you create training materials that explain ‘why’ policies exist, not just ‘what’ they are”\n\n\nSee the difference? The AI didn’t just rattle off generic suggestions. It understood your specific role, constraints, and challenges. The recommendations are contextual and actionable."

    "text": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) is fundamentally reshaping pedagogy. This overview outlines the five key areas of impact, from the core technology and its effect on course design and delivery to the critical challenges and the re-humanization of the educator’s role\nThe following five topics successfully organise the discussion across the technology itself (ITS), the impact on professional roles (The Architect, The Practitioner), the systemic obstacles (Challenges & Limitations), and the resulting transformation of the human professional (The Evolving Role of the Educator).\n\n\nKey Takeaway: ITS deliver personalised, one-on-one instruction by relying on an integrated architecture of four key components: the Domain Model (what is taught), the Learner Model (who is learning, including successes and misconceptions), the Tutoring Model (how to teach), and the User Interface Model (interaction). The quality of instruction is directly determined by the sophistication of these underlying models, which collectively ensure that the system adjusts the pace, difficulty, and focus of lessons in real-time.\nAnalogy: Intelligent Tutoring Systems function much like an automated personal trainer at a gym. Just as the trainer analyzes your current fitness level, pace, and weaknesses (the Student Model), knows the curriculum of exercises (the Domain Model), and determines the optimal routine to challenge you without overwhelming you (the Tutoring Model), the ITS continuously adjusts the learning path to ensure instruction is both challenging and achievable, promoting deeper understanding.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: AI fundamentally transforms the pedagogical designer’s role from a manual content creator to a Strategic Architect by automating previously slow and tedious tasks, such as generating course outlines, assessments, and multimedia. This automation forces the designer to focus on high-level, human-centric design—creating flexible, dynamic frameworks and addressing emotional barriers to learning, rather than formatting slides or writing quiz questions.\nAnalogy: If traditional pedagogical design was like crafting a single, hand-built ship (a static course) that everyone had to sail on, the AI era redesigns the role of the architect. The new Pedagogical Architect now designs a complex, adaptive fleet where each ship (module) can adjust its sails, speed, and navigation (difficulty, pace, content) based on the real-time weather (student performance data), ensuring everyone reaches their destination, but along a personalised route. The architect’s most critical new job is ensuring the human crew (teachers and students) still communicate and build rapport, not just follow the automated navigation system.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: AI revolutionizes pedagogical delivery by collapsing the feedback loop and providing educators with real-time data insights into student progress, performance patterns, and cognitive states. This data-driven delivery allows the human teacher to transition into a “real-time interventionist,” enabling them to abandon content presentation to the “average” student and instead focus on targeted, high-value interventions based on immediate, actionable data. It can be viewed the impact of AI on pedagogical delivery not as a replacement for the teacher, but as an augmented reality for the classroom. AI handles the mechanics of instruction and data analysis, allowing the human practitioner to execute their craft with surgical precision, focusing their limited time on high-value, empathetic, and complex human interactions.\nAnalogy:. AI in the classroom functions as an AI Co-Pilot. The AI (co-pilot) handles the routine mechanics of flight (content delivery, system monitoring, and performance tracking), allowing the human pilot (the educator) to focus on complex navigation, communicating with the crew (students), and managing unexpected turbulence (misconceptions or emotional barriers) with surgical precision.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: Despite the technological promise, a critical challenge for AIED is the risk of eroding the human element and exacerbating educational inequity through algorithmic bias. Over-reliance on ITS can reduce valuable face-to-face interactions, while studies show that students using AI sometimes feel less connected to their teachers (the “paradox of connection”). Furthermore, predictive models trained on historical data risk perpetuating existing biases against marginalized groups when allocating resources or flagging “at-risk” learners.\nAnalogy: Think of AIED as a new, highly efficient Automated Factory. While it produces learning materials at scale (efficiency), it risks creating a sterile, one-size-fits-all product that lacks the “human touch” (eroding connection). More dangerously, if the factory’s blueprints (the algorithm) have a flaw (bias), it doesn’t just create one bad product; it replicates that flaw thousands of times, perpetuating the inequity at scale.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway: The long-term impact of AI is a forced re-humanization of the educator’s role, where the practitioner is compelled to abandon the commoditized, technical tasks (which AI can perform) and focus on the Human Edge of AI. This means prioritizing empathy, creativity, strategic thinking, mentorship, and socio-emotional support—the unique human skills vital for holistic student development that AI fundamentally cannot replicate. Educators must also become proficient in interpreting AI data and developing ethical reasoning to guide responsible technology use.\nAnalogy: The integration of AI is like a Rising Tide. As the AI “tide” rises, it automates and submerges all the routine, technical “lowlands” of the job (grading, content delivery). This forces the educator to move to the “high ground”—the uniquely human skills of empathy, mentorship, and creative problem-solving that the tide cannot reach. Their value is no longer in the submerged tasks, but on this new, more human-centric high ground."

    "text": "In the context of Artificial Intelligence, the terms Black Swan and Grey Swan refer to how we categorize and prepare for risks. They are metaphors describing high-impact events based on how predictable they are.\nHere is the breakdown of Black Swan vs. Grey Swan events specifically within the AI landscape.\n\n1. Black Swan Event\nThe Definition: A Black Swan event is an occurrence that is unpredictable, has a massive impact, and is often rationalized in hindsight (we look back and say, “we should have seen that coming,” even though we couldn’t have).\nIn AI, these are “unknown unknowns.” They represent scenarios that are not in our training data, not in our risk models, and often fundamentally change the trajectory of the technology or society.\n\nKey Characteristics:\n\nRarity: It is an outlier; nothing in the past points to its possibility.\nImpact: Extreme consequences (catastrophic or revolutionary).\nRetrospective Predictability: Explanations are concocted after the fact.\n\n\nExamples in AI Context: * Emergent Capabilities: An AI model suddenly developing a capability it was never trained for and that developers did not believe was possible (e.g., a language model suddenly solving unsolved mathematical theorems without specific training). * The “Flash Crash” Scenario: Interconnected AI trading bots simultaneously hallucinating a market trend that doesn’t exist, crashing the global economy in seconds before humans can pull the plug. * Zero-Day Exploits: A novel AI-generated cyberattack that bypasses all known security protocols because it utilizes a logic path no human coder ever considered.\n\n\n\n2. Grey Swan Event\nThe Definition: A Grey Swan event is predictable and known to be possible, but is considered unlikely to happen.\nIn AI, these are “known unknowns.” We know the risk exists, and we might even have a name for it, but we often ignore it or under-prepare because the probability seems low.\n\nKey Characteristics:\n\nForeseeability: We know it could happen (it has precedents or is theoretically obvious).\nNeglect: It is often dismissed as too expensive or complex to prevent.\nImpact: Significant, often cascading through systems.\n\n\nExamples in AI Context: * Infrastructure Collapse: A geopolitical conflict (e.g., in Taiwan) cutting off the supply of advanced GPUs (Nvidia chips), causing a sudden, long-term freeze in global AI development. We know this is a supply chain bottleneck, but the industry operates as if it won’t happen. * Legal/Copyright Shutdown: A supreme court ruling that declares all training on copyrighted data illegal, forcing major foundation models (like GPT-4 or Claude) to be deleted or retrained from scratch. This is a known legal risk that companies are currently “betting” against. * Data Poisoning: A coordinated attack where bad actors slowly feed “poisoned” data into open-source datasets over years, leading to a sudden, widespread failure of models that rely on that data.\n\n\nSummary Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nBlack Swan (AI)\nGrey Swan (AI)\n\n\n\n\nPredictability\nImpossible to predict\nPossible to predict (but unlikely)\n\n\nAwareness\n“We didn’t know this could happen.”\n“We knew this could happen, but didn’t think it would.”\n\n\nPreparation\nImpossible to prepare for specifically; requires general resilience.\nPossible to mitigate, but often ignored due to cost/effort.\n\n\nAnalogy\nAliens landing and giving us super-code.\nA massive solar flare wiping out data centers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The C.R.A.F.T. framework is a practical, structured approach to writing better prompts for AI tools.\n\nGetting started? If you’re new to AI or unsure where to begin, consider starting with “Using AI to Help You Use AI” first. That meta-skill will help you discover your own starting point, and then CRAFT becomes a powerful tool for structuring the prompts you actually need.\n\nWhether you’re an educator, researcher, or professional staff member, CRAFT helps you communicate clearly with AI and get more relevant, high-quality results.\nMost disappointing AI outputs result from vague or context-free prompts. The good news? Structured prompts produce dramatically better results with less rework.\n\nThink of prompting like briefing a colleague: The better you brief the AI, the better its draft.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe framework has five elements. You don’t need to use all of them every time, but they provide a useful scaffold:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\nElement\nWhat It Means\nExample\n\n\n\n\nC\nContext\nWhat’s the background? What data or situation are we working with?\n“This is student enrolment data from business units over three semesters.”\n\n\nR\nRole\nWhat role should the AI take on?\n“You are an experienced teaching coordinator.”\n\n\nA\nAction\nWhat specifically should the AI do?\n“Analyse trends and identify units at risk.”\n\n\nF\nFormat\nHow should the output be structured?\n“Provide results as bullet points.”\n\n\nT\nTone/Target\nWhat tone, and who’s the audience?\n“Use clear language suitable for faculty meetings.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity: Removes ambiguity from what you’re asking\nConsistency: Works across all AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.)\nQuality: Reduces rework by 30–50% in most cases\nSpeed: Takes just a few extra seconds to set up\nCollaboration: Frames AI as a thinking partner, not just a tool\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: CRAFT is one framework among many. Different prompting techniques work better for different people and different tasks. There’s no single “correct” way to prompt AI.\nSome educators and professionals find CRAFT helpful and structured. Others prefer simpler, more conversational approaches. The goal is clarity—not adherence to a framework.\n\n\n1. Ask for step-by-step thinking Instead of asking for a final answer, ask the AI to walk through its reasoning first: &gt; “Before answering, walk me through how you’d approach this problem. Then provide your recommendation.”\n2. Request explicit reasoning Ask the AI to show its work: &gt; “Explain your thinking before providing the assessment rubric.” &gt; “How did you arrive at that conclusion?”\n3. Provide good and bad examples Show the AI what you want (and what you don’t): &gt; “Here’s an example of a good discussion question: [example]. Here’s a weak one: [bad example]. Now create three questions in the style of the good example.”\n4. Use comparative framing Ask the AI to compare or contrast: &gt; “Show me three different ways to explain this concept. What are the trade-offs of each?”\n5. Break tasks into explicit steps Similar to prompt chaining, but simpler: &gt; “First, summarise this. Then identify problems. Finally, suggest solutions.”\n6. Ask for constraints Tell the AI what matters: &gt; “Keep this under 150 words. Make it suitable for high school students. Use simple language.”\n7. Request revision and refinement Most first drafts improve with feedback: &gt; “That’s a good start. Now make it more concise / more detailed / more critical / more encouraging.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best approach is the one that: - Makes sense to you (you understand why you’re structuring the prompt that way) - Works for your context (some frameworks fit teaching, others fit analysis) - Gets consistent results (you can repeat it and improve it)\nSome people love the CRAFT framework. Others find it overly formal. Some prefer conversational, exploratory prompting. Others prefer ultra-specific, constraint-based prompting.\nTry different techniques and notice what works: - Does CRAFT help you think through what you need? - Or do you prefer just asking clearly and iterating? - Do you like step-by-step structure, or does it feel rigid? - Do examples help you, or do you work better with descriptions?\nThere’s no “wrong” answer—just what works for your brain and your context.\n\n\n\n\nWhatever technique you use, the underlying principle is the same:\n\nHelp the AI understand what you actually want.\n\nWhether you do that through CRAFT, through examples, through step-by-step instructions, or through something else entirely—the goal is clarity. If your current approach isn’t getting good results, try something different.\nNo framework is universal. CRAFT happens to be structured and teachable, which is why we highlight it. But your own conversational style, combined with iteration, is often just as effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak Prompt: &gt; “How can I use AI in my class?”\nCRAFT-Improved Prompt: &gt; “I teach first-year business students in a capstone project unit. You are an instructional designer. Suggest three practical ways to integrate AI tools without replacing authentic student work. Format as a bulleted list with implementation tips. Use language suitable for sharing with faculty colleagues.”\nWhy it’s better: - Context: We know the student level, discipline, and unit type - Role: AI knows what perspective to take (instructional designer) - Action: Clear, specific request (three ways, with implementation) - Format: Structured output (bullets + tips) - Tone: Colleague-appropriate language\n\n\n\n\nWeak Prompt: &gt; “Analyse this data.”\nCRAFT-Improved Prompt: &gt; “This CSV contains survey responses from 200 educators about AI adoption barriers. You are a research analyst. Identify the top 5 themes and frequency for each. Flag any surprising or contradictory patterns. Output as a structured summary with key quotes. Keep language technical but accessible for a research paper methods section.”\nWhy it’s better: - Context: Dataset size, content, source - Role: Research analyst (appropriate perspective) - Action: Specific analyses (themes, frequencies, contradictions, quotes) - Format: Structured summary - Tone: Suitable for academic writing\n\n\n\n\nWeak Prompt: &gt; “Summarise this compliance document.”\nCRAFT-Improved Prompt: &gt; “This is a TEQSA compliance framework document. You are a senior teaching support officer. Extract the three most critical requirements for our business faculty. Highlight any compliance gaps we might have. Format as a one-page summary with clear action items. Use plain English suitable for a faculty board update.”\nWhy it’s better: - Context: Document type and regulatory body - Role: TSO (operational expertise) - Action: Extract + identify gaps + recommend actions - Format: One-page, action-oriented - Tone: Board-appropriate\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s something important: One-shot prompts tend toward sameness and averageness. When you ask AI a single question and take the first answer, you get polished, predictable, middle-of-the-road output. That’s not because AI is limited—it’s because you haven’t had a conversation yet.\nThe real exploration happens in the follow-up prompts. That’s where you push thinking deeper, challenge assumptions, ask for nuance, and steer toward your specific context and needs.\n\nThink of AI prompting like a conversation with a capable colleague, not like asking a search engine for an answer.\n\n\n\n\nFirst answers are drafts, not final thoughts. AI hasn’t yet understood your actual needs, constraints, or what matters to you.\nFollow-ups reveal depth. “What am I missing?” or “Now dig deeper on that second point” pushes AI toward more thoughtful output.\nYou shape the thinking through dialogue. Each question you ask steers the conversation in new directions.\nSpecificity emerges through iteration. Vague initial responses become sharp and contextual through rounds of back-and-forth.\nYour expertise guides the exploration. You know your discipline, your students, your institution. AI should adapt to that, not the other way around.\n\n\n\n\nOne-shot prompt (what many people do): &gt; “How can I use AI in my teaching?”\nOutput: Generic, average, 3–4 safe suggestions that apply to everyone\n\nConversational approach (what actually works):\nPrompt 1 (CRAFT starting point): &gt; “I teach business ethics to 2nd-year students. You are a pedagogy expert. What are 3 ways to use AI that deepen ethical thinking rather than replacing it? Include one activity for each. Format for colleague discussion.”\nOutput: Reasonable, but still somewhat generic\nPrompt 2 (Follow-up - push toward depth): &gt; “Those are helpful. The third one about ‘AI bias analysis’—that’s interesting. Can you walk me through what a student would actually do in that activity? What would the AI’s role be, what would the student’s role be, and how would you know if they’re thinking critically versus just using AI?”\nOutput: Much more specific. You’re now co-designing the activity.\nPrompt 3 (Follow-up - address your specific concern): &gt; “Here’s my real worry: won’t students just copy what the AI says instead of forming their own ethical positions? How would you redesign this to force genuine student thinking?”\nOutput: Now AI is addressing your actual concern, not a hypothetical one.\nPrompt 4 (Follow-up - make it practical): &gt; “I like that. Now create a rubric I could actually use to grade this. What would ‘demonstrates genuine ethical reasoning’ look like versus ‘used AI as a crutch’? Make it specific enough that I can show it to students.”\nOutput: Practical tool, directly usable in your classroom.\nPrompt 5 (Follow-up - iterate toward refinement): &gt; “Good rubric. But I think ‘Excellent’ is too hard to achieve. Can you adjust the criteria so that most engaged students could reach ‘Proficient’? I don’t want to discourage them.”\nOutput: Refined rubric that matches your teaching philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-shot: Generic advice, moderate usefulness, minimal iteration\nConversation: Specific to your context, increasingly useful, deeply refined\n\nThe first prompt got you in the ballpark. Prompts 2–5 got you a tool you’ll actually use.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the workflow that actually works:\n\nUse CRAFT (or another framework) for your first prompt. This ensures clarity and sets a good foundation.\nReview the output. What’s helpful? What’s missing? What surprised you?\nAsk follow-up questions. This is where the real thinking happens:\n\n“Tell me more about…”\n“Why would that work for…?”\n“How would I actually implement that?”\n“What am I not considering?”\n“Now adapt that for [specific context]…”\n“Push back on that idea—what are the risks?”\n\nUse CRAFT in your follow-ups too. You can apply the framework again (Context, Role, Action, Format, Tone) to make follow-up prompts just as clear as your first one.\nKeep exploring until you have what you need. There’s no “right” number of follow-ups. Stop when the output matches your thinking, not before.\n\n\n\nInitial Prompt (CRAFT): &gt; Context: I teach supply chain management. Role: You are a operations expert. Action: Suggest assessment methods for sustainability thinking. Format: 3 approaches with pros/cons. Tone: Suitable for faculty planning.\nFollow-up 1 (Simple follow-up): &gt; “That middle approach about portfolio assessment—tell me more. What would students actually submit? How often?”\nFollow-up 2 (CRAFT framework in follow-up): &gt; “Context: We have 60 students per semester. Role: You’re a teaching coordinator worried about marking time. Action: Adapt portfolio approach to be feasible with 60 students. What can be automated, what must be human-marked? Format: Step-by-step implementation. Tone: Realistic about constraints.”\nFollow-up 3 (Simple exploration): &gt; “That’s helpful. What are the trade-offs? What would we lose by streamlining it that way?”\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s actually happening in this back-and-forth:\n\nYou’re not training the AI. (It doesn’t learn or remember between sessions)\nYou’re narrowing the scope. (Each question focuses attention on what matters to you)\nYou’re surfacing your expertise. (Your follow-ups reveal what you know and what you care about)\nYou’re iterating toward clarity. (Neither you nor the AI knew exactly what you wanted until you started talking)\nYou’re quality-checking. (You catch generic advice and push for specificity)\n\nThe conversation works because you’re applying human judgment throughout. You’re not accepting outputs blindly; you’re critically engaging with them, asking for depth, pushing back, and steering toward what actually matters in your context.\nThat’s where value emerges.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you ask a single question and take the first answer:\n\nNo context refinement. The AI made assumptions; you didn’t correct them.\nSurface-level output. First answers are often polished but generic.\nNo personal touch. You got advice for “educators” generally, not advice for you specifically.\nMissed opportunities. The AI has more to offer, but you didn’t ask.\n\nConversely, when you engage in dialogue:\n\nThe AI learns your context. (Within the conversation)\nYou surface your expertise. (Through follow-up questions)\nOutput becomes increasingly specific. (With each round of refinement)\nYou maintain agency. (You’re steering, not just receiving)\n\n\n\n\nIf your first output feels generic or “average,” you haven’t asked enough follow-up questions yet.\n\nThat’s not a failure. That’s a signal to keep exploring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you actually want to accomplish?\nWhat’s the starting point (data, concept, problem)?\nWho’s the audience?\n\n\n\n\n\nC: Provide context (what’s the background/data?)\nR: State the role (what expertise should AI bring?)\nA: State the action (what specifically should it do?)\nF: Specify format (bullets, paragraphs, table, etc.)\nT: Define tone/target (who reads this, what tone works?)\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste your prompt into your AI tool\nReview the output\nNote what’s helpful and what’s missing\n\n\n\n\n\nUse follow-ups to refine, extend, or adapt\nTry “Now rewrite that for [different audience]”\nTry “What’s one thing we missed?”\nTry “Make that more/less technical”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat prompt worked best?\nWhat follow-ups added the most value?\nWhat would you do differently next time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to adapt these templates for your context:\n\n\nContext: [Describe your students, unit, discipline, learning outcome]\nRole: You are [pedagogical expertise needed: instructional designer, curriculum specialist, etc.]\nAction: [Specific task: suggest strategies, design activities, develop rubric, etc.]\nFormat: [How should output be structured?]\nTone: [Audience and tone: colleague workshop, student-facing, etc.]\n\n\n\nContext: [Data source, sample size, research question, discipline]\nRole: You are [research role: data analyst, methodologist, literature reviewer, etc.]\nAction: [Specific analysis: identify themes, compare approaches, evaluate evidence, etc.]\nFormat: [Structure: summary, table, narrative, etc.]\nTone: [Suitable for: research paper, conference presentation, grant proposal, etc.]\n\n\n\nContext: [Document/data type, organisational context, compliance/operational need]\nRole: You are [professional role: teaching coordinator, policy analyst, compliance officer, etc.]\nAction: [Specific task: extract requirements, identify risks, recommend actions, etc.]\nFormat: [Structure: summary, action list, comparison, etc.]\nTone: [Audience: leadership, faculty, staff, etc.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe specific, not verbose. CRAFT doesn’t require long prompts—just clear ones.\nContext is crucial. The more relevant background you provide, the better the output.\nRole matters. Assigning a role helps AI understand what perspective and expertise to bring.\nFormat guides quality. Specifying bullet points vs. paragraphs vs. tables changes output structure significantly.\nTone prevents misfits. What works for a faculty meeting doesn’t work for a student email. Be explicit.\nFollow-ups are where the value lives. First outputs are drafts; follow-ups are refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMistake\nWhat Happens\nFix\n\n\n\n\nNo context\nAI makes too many assumptions or produces generic output\nProvide relevant background (data, students, discipline, situation)\n\n\nVague role\nOutput lacks appropriate perspective or expertise\nSpecify a concrete role (e.g., “instructional designer” not just “expert”)\n\n\nUnclear action\nYou get something but not what you needed\nSay exactly what you want it to do (analyse, design, critique, summarise, etc.)\n\n\nNo format specification\nOutput is unstructured or in wrong format\nSay “bullet points” or “three paragraphs” or “comparison table”\n\n\nMismatched tone\nGood content but wrong for your audience\nName your audience explicitly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry improving this weak prompt using CRAFT:\nWeak Prompt: &gt; “How do I teach AI literacy?”\nYour Task: Using the CRAFT framework: 1. Add context (what students? what discipline? what level?) 2. Define a role (what expertise?) 3. Clarify the action (what specifically do you want?) 4. Specify format (how should it be organised?) 5. State the tone/target (who’s the audience?)\nThen try your CRAFT prompt in an AI tool and see how the output improves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRAFT isn’t about creating the perfect prompt. It’s about starting a better conversation with AI.\nYou don’t need the ideal prompt on the first try. You need clarity, curiosity, and a willingness to iterate. AI will meet you halfway—but only if you bring specificity and a challenge worth solving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Art of the Prompt” - Seven Techniques guide (for pedagogical prompts)\n“Prompt Chaining Techniques” - Multi-step workflows and reasoning\nSeven Essential Prompt Techniques for Business Teaching - Deep dive into discipline-specific prompts"

That’s where you push thinking deeper, challenge assumptions, ask for nuance, and steer toward your specific context and needs.\n\nThink of AI prompting like a conversation with a capable colleague, not like asking a search engine for an answer.\n\n\n\n\nFirst answers are drafts, not final thoughts. AI hasn’t yet understood your actual needs, constraints, or what matters to you.\nFollow-ups reveal depth. “What am I missing?” or “Now dig deeper on that second point” pushes AI toward more thoughtful output.\nYou shape the thinking through dialogue. Each question you ask steers the conversation in new directions.\nSpecificity emerges through iteration. Vague initial responses become sharp and contextual through rounds of back-and-forth.\nYour expertise guides the exploration. You know your discipline, your students, your institution. AI should adapt to that, not the other way around.\n\n\n\n\nOne-shot prompt (what many people do): &gt; “How can I use AI in my teaching?”\nOutput: Generic, average, 3–4 safe suggestions that apply to everyone\n\nConversational approach (what actually works):\nPrompt 1 (CRAFT starting point): &gt; “I teach business ethics to 2nd-year students. You are a pedagogy expert. What are 3 ways to use AI that deepen ethical thinking rather than replacing it? Include one activity for each. Format for colleague discussion.”\nOutput: Reasonable, but still somewhat generic\nPrompt 2 (Follow-up - push toward depth): &gt; “Those are helpful. The third one about ‘AI bias analysis’—that’s interesting. Can you walk me through what a student would actually do in that activity? What would the AI’s role be, what would the student’s role be, and how would you know if they’re thinking critically versus just using AI?”\nOutput: Much more specific. You’re now co-designing the activity.\nPrompt 3 (Follow-up - address your specific concern): &gt; “Here’s my real worry: won’t students just copy what the AI says instead of forming their own ethical positions? How would you redesign this to force genuine student thinking?”\nOutput: Now AI is addressing your actual concern, not a hypothetical one.\nPrompt 4 (Follow-up - make it practical): &gt; “I like that. Now create a rubric I could actually use to grade this. What would ‘demonstrates genuine ethical reasoning’ look like versus ‘used AI as a crutch’? Make it specific enough that I can show it to students.”\nOutput: Practical tool, directly usable in your classroom.\nPrompt 5 (Follow-up - iterate toward refinement): &gt; “Good rubric. But I think ‘Excellent’ is too hard to achieve. Can you adjust the criteria so that most engaged students could reach ‘Proficient’? I don’t want to discourage them.”\nOutput: Refined rubric that matches your teaching philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-shot: Generic advice, moderate usefulness, minimal iteration\nConversation: Specific to your context, increasingly useful, deeply refined\n\nThe first prompt got you in the ballpark. Prompts 2–5 got you a tool you’ll actually use."

There’s no “right” number of follow-ups. Stop when the output matches your thinking, not before.\n\n\n\nInitial Prompt (CRAFT): &gt; Context: I teach supply chain management. Role: You are a operations expert. Action: Suggest assessment methods for sustainability thinking. Format: 3 approaches with pros/cons. Tone: Suitable for faculty planning.\nFollow-up 1 (Simple follow-up): &gt; “That middle approach about portfolio assessment—tell me more. What would students actually submit? How often?”\nFollow-up 2 (CRAFT framework in follow-up): &gt; “Context: We have 60 students per semester. Role: You’re a teaching coordinator worried about marking time. Action: Adapt portfolio approach to be feasible with 60 students. What can be automated, what must be human-marked? Format: Step-by-step implementation. Tone: Realistic about constraints.”\nFollow-up 3 (Simple exploration): &gt; “That’s helpful. What are the trade-offs? What would we lose by streamlining it that way?”"

    "title": "Skills-Based Summary: AI Prompting from Concept to Application",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Missed the workshop? This guide distils the core prompting skills into digestible summaries. Each skill is presented as a conceptual foundation (2 sentences) plus pointers to deeper resources. Think of this as your “cheat sheet for AI competence.”\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: C.R.A.F.T. is a structured framework for clarity—Context (background), Role (what perspective should AI take), Action (what do you want it to do), Format (how should output be structured), and Tone/Target (who’s the audience). The underlying principle: clear input produces clear output, and most disappointing AI results come from vague prompts, not AI limitations.\nWhy it matters: Prompting isn’t magic—it’s communication. A 30-second investment in clarity saves 10 minutes of revision.\nGo deeper: C.R.A.F.T. Prompting Framework\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: Rather than guessing how AI might help you, use AI as a diagnostic tool—have it interview you about your role, challenges, and context, then it recommends both obvious and non-obvious applications tailored specifically to you. This meta-skill (using AI to teach you how to use AI) is uniquely powerful because AI can adapt to your specific situation in ways generic advice cannot.\nWhy it matters: You already know your work better than anyone. Let AI help you surface possibilities you would find valuable, not generic suggestions.\nGo deeper: Using AI to Help You Use AI\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: Beyond CRAFT, there are discipline-specific techniques proven to work in educational contexts: asking AI to role-play pedagogical scenarios, building scaffolded questions that match Bloom’s Taxonomy, using AI as a “thought partner” for course design, having it simulate student misconceptions, and more. These aren’t random tricks—they’re grounded in learning science and pedagogy.\nWhy it matters: Different contexts need different approaches. Knowing multiple techniques lets you choose the right tool for your teaching challenge.\nGo deeper: Seven Essential Prompt Techniques for Business Teaching\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: Long conversations have limits—AI attention fades, hallucination risk increases, and output tokens get divided among multiple asks. The solution: break complex projects into focused sub-tasks, use separate conversations for different topics, and ask AI to summarize progress before starting fresh. Context management isn’t optional; it’s the difference between shallow and deep outputs.\nWhy it matters: A 5-minute conversation about one thing beats a 50-exchange conversation trying to do everything. Better outputs, fewer errors, clearer thinking.\nGo deeper: Managing Context with AI\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: Once you master basic prompting, you can ask AI to take on complex roles: simulating difficult student conversations, generating assessment rubrics and test items, role-playing stakeholder meetings, or even designing interactive learning simulations. These aren’t harder prompts—they’re skilled applications of CRAFT and context management where you’re asking AI to perform a specific pedagogical function.\nWhy it matters: AI becomes most valuable when you stop treating it as a text-generation tool and start using it as a pedagogical instrument—a simulator, evaluator, or learning partner.\nApplications: - Assessment design: “You are an assessment specialist.

What concerns would you raise?”\nGo deeper: AI in Pedagogical Design & Delivery | Cognitive Prompting in Education\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: The magic happens when you chain prompts: first generate ideas, then refine them, then adapt for different audiences, then format for delivery. A teaching strategy that emerges from dialogue (not one-shot generation) is higher quality and more personally aligned. The workflow is: explore → review → refine → adapt → finalise.\nWhy it matters: One conversation rarely produces a finished document. Iterative dialogue—where you provide feedback after each step—produces outputs that actually match what you need.\nExample workflow: 1. Explore: “What are 5 ways to integrate AI without replacing authentic student work?” 2. Review: “I like option 3. Tell me more about implementation.” 3. Refine: “That’s good, but make it feasible for a class of 80.” 4. Adapt: “Now turn this into a 1-page faculty handout.” 5. Finalise: “Great. Make it more encouraging and less technical.”\nGo deeper: Prompt Chaining Techniques\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Summary: The bleeding edge includes AI agents (multi-step autonomous systems that solve problems without human intervention between steps), prompt automation (tools that run complex prompt chains without you typing each step), and emerging capabilities like real-time data access, image generation, and code execution. These aren’t essential for most educators, but they’re the horizon—understanding what’s possible helps you think strategically about future integration.\nWhy it matters: The AI landscape changes quarterly. Staying aware of emerging tools and approaches means you’re not caught off-guard when new capabilities arrive, and you can evaluate them thoughtfully rather than reactively.\nEmerging areas to watch: - Agentic workflows: AI systems that plan, execute, and evaluate their own work - Multi-modal prompting: Combining text, images, audio, and code in single prompts - Custom knowledge bases: Uploading your own documents so AI learns your context - Real-time data: AI access to current information (weather, news, institutional databases) - Integration with learning platforms: AI embedded directly in your LMS\nCurrent resources: - References & Further Reading (research and emerging papers) - Industry blogs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind\n\n\n\n\nThink of these skills as layers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nSkills\nFocus\n\n\n\n\nFoundational\nBasic prompting (CRAFT), Personal strategy discovery\nHow to communicate clearly with AI, what AI can do for you\n\n\nCore\nSeven techniques, Context management\nHow to apply AI thoughtfully in your discipline, how to structure complex work\n\n\nApplied\nSophisticated applications, Document creation\nHow to use AI as a pedagogical tool, how to produce polished deliverables\n\n\nAdvanced\nAdvanced topics\nWhat’s coming next, how to think strategically about AI evolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re starting out: 1.

    "title": "What are Large Language Models (LLMs)? A Non-Technical Introduction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Reading time: 12 minutes\nPrerequisites: Read “What is AI?” first for context\n\n\n\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is AI trained to predict the next word in a sentence.\nThat’s it. That’s the core idea.\nBut from that simple task—predicting the next word—these models learned to:\n\nWrite essays, emails, code, and poetry\nAnswer questions about almost any topic\nTranslate languages\nSummarize documents\nExplain complex concepts\nHold conversations\n\nExamples you’ve probably heard of:\n\nChatGPT (OpenAI)\nClaude (Anthropic)\nGemini (Google)\nCopilot (Microsoft)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems magical, but here’s the intuition:\n\n\nImagine you’re a child learning language. Someone shows you thousands of examples:\nExample 1:\n“The cat sat on the ___” → You learn: “mat” is likely (from seeing this pattern before)\nExample 2:\n“I went to the store to buy ___” → You learn: “milk,” “bread,” “groceries” are likely (from context)\nExample 3:\n“The capital of France is ___” → You learn: “Paris” (you’ve seen this fact stated before)\nExample 4:\n“If you drop a glass, it will ___” → You learn: “break” or “shatter” (cause and effect)\nNow multiply that by billions of examples from:\n\nWikipedia\nBooks\nNews articles\nWebsites\nCode repositories\nAcademic papers\nReddit conversations\nSocial media\n\nBy learning to predict the next word, the AI absorbed:\n\nGrammar and syntax (how language works)\nFacts about the world (Paris is the capital of France)\nCommon sense (glass breaks when dropped)\nHow arguments are structured (how to explain things)\nDifferent writing styles (formal, casual, technical, creative)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know autocomplete on your phone?\nYour phone suggests:\n“I’m running late, I’ll ___” → “be there soon” (common phrase)\nAn LLM is like that, but:\n\nTrained on trillions of words (not just your texts)\nCan predict entire paragraphs, not just one word\nCan change style, tone, and complexity\nCan incorporate context from earlier in the conversation\n\nExample conversation:\nYou: “Explain photosynthesis”\nLLM thinks:\n\nContext: science topic, explanation needed\nStyle: educational but accessible\nStructure: definition → process → significance\nNext words likely: “Photosynthesis is the process…”\n\nLLM responds: “Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy…”\nIt’s predicting what words would naturally come next in an explanation of photosynthesis based on millions of similar explanations it’s seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Huge Amount of Training Data\n\nTrained on hundreds of billions of words\nEquivalent to reading millions of books\nTakes weeks/months to train\n\n2. Massive Number of Parameters\n\n“Parameters” = the patterns the model learned\nGPT-3: 175 billion parameters\nGPT-4: Rumored to be over 1 trillion parameters\nThink of parameters as: “In this context, this word is more likely than that word”\n\n3.

Don’t use for math, current events, or critical factual accuracy without verification.\nAlways have human oversight - LLMs hallucinate, have biases, and make mistakes. Humans review before outputs go to customers or affect decisions.\nStart small and measure - Pilot with low-risk use cases. Track accuracy, quality, and satisfaction. Iterate based on results.\nThey’re tools, not magic - LLMs are powerful but limited. Success comes from using them well, not just using them."

    "text": "LLMs are “autocomplete on steroids” - They predict likely next words based on massive training, which lets them write, explain, summarize, and converse.\nThey’re great at language tasks, not everything - Use for writing, summarization, Q&A, translation. Don’t use for math, current events, or critical factual accuracy without verification.\nAlways have human oversight - LLMs hallucinate, have biases, and make mistakes. Humans review before outputs go to customers or affect decisions.\nStart small and measure - Pilot with low-risk use cases. Track accuracy, quality, and satisfaction. Iterate based on results.\nThey’re tools, not magic - LLMs are powerful but limited. Success comes from using them well, not just using them."

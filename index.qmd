# Teaching with AI: From Passive Users to Critical Partners

**Assessment 2030 Showcase Presentation**  
*Curtin University - Teaching with AI: Showcase presentations for Innovation*

---

## About This Presentation

This showcase presents an innovative assessment approach designed for a GenAI-driven world. The presentation demonstrates how to move students from being passive users of AI tools to becoming critical partners in their learning and professional practice.

## Presentation Content

The full presentation is available in two formats:

- **[Presentation Slides](slides.html)** - The visual presentation with key points and images
- **[Presentation with Notes](slides-notes.html)** - The complete presentation including speaker notes and detailed explanations

## Key Innovation: The 'CloudCore' Audit

This assessment features a two-pronged approach to AI integration:

1. **AI as the "Client"** - Students interact with AI-powered characters in a simulated business environment
2. **AI as the "Intern"** - Students work with LLMs as junior assistants, learning to critically evaluate and refine AI output

## Learning Objectives

- Teach students to think *with* AI rather than just use AI
- Develop skills in effective prompting and critical evaluation
- Prepare students for AI-amplified professional practice
- Maintain academic integrity through transparency and process assessment

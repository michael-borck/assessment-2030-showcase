# Quarto Configuration Notes

## The Problem

Quarto's `type: website` mode automatically generates an `index.html` redirect page, overwriting our custom landing page on every render.

## The Solution

We use a **post-render script** (`restore-index.sh`) that runs after Quarto finishes rendering to restore our custom index.html.

### How It Works

1. **Quarto renders** all content files (`content/*.qmd`) to `docs/content/`
2. **Quarto generates** its automatic index.html redirect
3. **Post-render script runs** and replaces the redirect with our custom landing page
4. **Result**: Content pages have Quarto navbar, landing page has custom design

### To Render the Site

```bash
quarto render
```

The post-render hook automatically restores index.html after the render completes.

### Manual Index Restoration

If index.html gets corrupted, run:

```bash
./restore-index.sh
```

## Static HTML Files

These files are maintained separately (NOT generated by Quarto):

- `docs/index.html` - Landing page with quiz CTAs
- `docs/teaching-style-quiz.html` - Interactive quiz
- `docs/ai-literacy-diagnostic.html` - Assessment tool
- `docs/resources-hub.html` - Resource browser
- `docs/videos.html` - Video collection

**Important**: These files are tracked in git and should be committed manually when updated.

## GitHub Pages

- The `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub Pages not to use Jekyll processing
- This allows serving all HTML files directly, including those starting with `_`

## Alternative Approach (Future)

Consider switching to `type: default` with `include-before-body` for navigation:
- No automatic index.html generation
- Navigation injected into all pages via header file
- More manual control, less fighting with Quarto
